National Berniecratic Candidates,"Okay, so I hope this post does not get locked. I have helped compose a list of progressive primary challengers to centrist incumbent Democrats. Some of them are endorsed by Local Berniecrats, Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, DSA, or Brand New Congress. But, Brand New Congress only endorsed THREE challengers. Justice Democrats only released TWO new challengers. Our Revolution is not yet accepting 2020 nominations. We NEED to get rid of a few centrists at least in 2020 if we want to change anything, and they need to build their following now so they WILL get endorsed later. So, I am going to first post all of the candidates endorsed by official Berniecratic sources. Then I am going to post a link to Twitter --- I and another person have been compiling a list of progressive primary challengers who have a platform and issues page that mirrors the Bernie platform. Most of these candidates have confirmed they are TRYING to be endorsed by a Bernie-friendly source. We have compiled over 40 challengers. Follow. Share. Vote.

First, make sure you double-check [https://localberniecrats.com/](https://localberniecrats.com/) periodically. This site has local, state, and national candidates. Some of the candidates on the Twitter list are on Local Berniecrats already --- but that will take forever to cross-reference on here. We all need to be thinking about Congress as well as Bernie. We need to send in warriors to back him up (like...if all candidates could be like Joshua Collins from Washington's 10th, that would be excellent, he needs to be nominated and endorsed.)

Second, double-check Justice Democrats  [https://www.justicedemocrats.com/candidates](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/candidates) (Jamaal Bowman, NY-16, Jessica Cisneros, TX-28)

Third, check  [https://ourrevolution.com/candidates/](https://ourrevolution.com/candidates/) (No 2020 challengers, but some 2019 races)

Fourth, check  [https://brandnewcongress.org/](https://brandnewcongress.org/)  \--- Three challengers on the Twitter primary list (Cori Bush - MO-01, Anthony Clark, IL-07, Adrienne Bell TX-14)

Fifth, check out the Twitter list here (49 members!):  [https://twitter.com/rss303/lists/primary-challengers](https://twitter.com/rss303/lists/primary-challengers) 

Sixth: If you like one of the Twitter list candidates, and live in their area, nominate them for Justice Democrats, Our Revolution (when they start nominating), Local Berniecrats, and Brand New Congress. Below is the membership list for the Twitter list --- each candidate has a website that clearly states what their issues and goals are --- There may be a dud or two in here, but I've checked and double-checked and I cannot imagine that these candidates won't get endorsements (some who have been endorsed are listed below again).

Again, praying that this post is not locked because idk how else to get the word out about these candidates --- one gets drowned out on Twitter and Facebook. But there are 200k of us, if we got these people some attention, we could win. If you are aware of any other progressives running, let me know...and for the love of God if one of these candidates is in your district, write a letter to the editor, nominate them for an endorsement, etcetcetc.",bernie,"National Berniecratic Candidates Okay, so I hope this post does not get locked. I have helped compose a list of progressive primary challengers to centrist incumbent Democrats. Some of them are endorsed by Local Berniecrats, Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, DSA, or Brand New Congress. But, Brand New Congress only endorsed THREE challengers. Justice Democrats only released TWO new challengers. Our Revolution is not yet accepting 2020 nominations. We NEED to get rid of a few centrists at least in 2020 if we want to change anything, and they need to build their following now so they WILL get endorsed later. So, I am going to first post all of the candidates endorsed by official Berniecratic sources. Then I am going to post a link to Twitter --- I and another person have been compiling a list of progressive primary challengers who have a platform and issues page that mirrors the Bernie platform. Most of these candidates have confirmed they are TRYING to be endorsed by a Bernie-friendly source. We have compiled over 40 challengers. Follow. Share. Vote.

First, make sure you double-check [https://localberniecrats.com/](https://localberniecrats.com/) periodically. This site has local, state, and national candidates. Some of the candidates on the Twitter list are on Local Berniecrats already --- but that will take forever to cross-reference on here. We all need to be thinking about Congress as well as Bernie. We need to send in warriors to back him up (like...if all candidates could be like Joshua Collins from Washington's 10th, that would be excellent, he needs to be nominated and endorsed.)

Second, double-check Justice Democrats  [https://www.justicedemocrats.com/candidates](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/candidates) (Jamaal Bowman, NY-16, Jessica Cisneros, TX-28)

Third, check  [https://ourrevolution.com/candidates/](https://ourrevolution.com/candidates/) (No 2020 challengers, but some 2019 races)

Fourth, check  [https://brandnewcongress.org/](https://brandnewcongress.org/)  \--- Three challengers on the Twitter primary list (Cori Bush - MO-01, Anthony Clark, IL-07, Adrienne Bell TX-14)

Fifth, check out the Twitter list here (49 members!):  [https://twitter.com/rss303/lists/primary-challengers](https://twitter.com/rss303/lists/primary-challengers) 

Sixth: If you like one of the Twitter list candidates, and live in their area, nominate them for Justice Democrats, Our Revolution (when they start nominating), Local Berniecrats, and Brand New Congress. Below is the membership list for the Twitter list --- each candidate has a website that clearly states what their issues and goals are --- There may be a dud or two in here, but I've checked and double-checked and I cannot imagine that these candidates won't get endorsements (some who have been endorsed are listed below again).

Why I think people should vote for Bernie Sanders.,"First of all, I thought I should mention that, I'm neither a citizen of the US nor, a resident, but there are some things that I thought attention should be brought to.


On the first glance , many people would not like the fact that Bernie is a white, old, heterosexual, male, however, Him being that is a big part of the reason I think he should be president.

Hear me out,

Bernie was born in the early 1940s , in a climate in the US where homophobia, racism, sexism and xenophobia were very common to a very high extent that, young people now can't imagine the extent of it. A climate that serves every white, heterosexual, male. 


I would like you to ask yourself, how would your personality be if you were born around the same time. Would you be sexist, homophobic or xenophobic?

As much as we want to believe that we won't, odds are most of us would be.

Which brings us back to Bernie. Someone who was born and raised in such a climate,      that serves him in every way, and to turn out this way. That can only mean one thing, which is he really believes all of these things were wrong. He isn't doing it to follow the trend. He choose to be this way from the beginning.


I don't know how many times you've seen a white, heterosexual, male at the age of your grandparents to come out in public and oppose sexism, homophobia, and racism in such a genuine way from even before they were the trend. To propose policies that would open hell on himself because he believes they are right. This was a first for me.

For me I think of Bernie as a capable person with beleifs not just a politician or an ass kisser.",bernie,"Why I think people should vote for Bernie Sanders.

• Free college 
• Integration

There needs to be a real push for the sitting Progressives in Congress to endorse Senator Sanders,"A lot of people in r/politics love AOC, but half of them don't even realize that she was made possible through Justice Democrats, even less know who helped [start Justice Democrats](https://www.google.com/search?q=who+started+justice+democrats&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS728US728&amp;oq=who+started+justice+democ&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57.3744j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), and almost none of them know [why they were started in the first place](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/about).   


We need [these people](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/candidates) not to pull an 2016 Elizebeth Warren, sitting on the side lines while Senator Sanders needs them most. They need to make the pubic aware of how they came into Congress, who inspired them to run, and who they support.   


I honestly can't wrap my head around how Warren supporters don't give Senator Sanders credit for the young progressives in Congress, or popularizing Medicare for All after 2016. Is this cable news influence, or just willful ignorance at this point? 

&amp;#x200B;

If Bernie loses, it is very likely the Progressive movement will be co-opted by the Democratic establishment, but if he wins we could see the entire Democratic party transformed and [actually represent the interests of their constituents, and not bow to big pharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfEqr4UkFLw).

We need [these people](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/candidates) not to pull an 2016 Elizebeth Warren, sitting on the side lines while Senator Sanders needs them most. They need to make the pubic aware of how they came into Congress, who inspired them to run, and who they support.   


I honestly can't wrap my head around how Warren supporters don't give Senator Sanders credit for the young progressives in Congress, or popularizing Medicare for All after 2016. Is this cable news influence, or just willful ignorance at this point?

If Bernie loses, it is very likely the Progressive movement will be co-opted by the Democratic establishment, but if he wins we could see the entire Democratic party transformed and [actually represent the interests of their constituents, and not bow to big pharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfEqr4UkFLw).

Suggestions for freeing minds from the Establishment bubble.,"Hey all, first I hope you'll indulge me for a second. I will get to the point.

***TL;DR = How can we free people's minds from the establishment bubble.***

But I just turned 40, and up until 2015 I was trapped in the establishment bubble. I'd root for the Democrats or my home country's (Canada) Liberal Party like they were my favorite sports team. I'd viciously attack anyone who impugned their ""good"" name and attack anyone on the right without regard for the context of what they were saying. They're the bad guys, we're the good guys.

Then 2015 came along and Bernie ran for President and I was watching The Young Turks (before they sold out) and my mind was freed. It was a rough time for me, even though I was grateful to know the truth it still hurt. All of these people who I'd revered as on my side and fighting for the same things I was like Rachel Maddow, Bill Maher, Keith Olbermann, Barack Obama and so on were now exposed as frauds... I'd been supporting frauds all this time.

4 years later and I've come to terms with it, and now I'm a better person for it.

I know for a fact there are other people out there just like me who are trapped in the establishment bubble, and that they could be great progressives working towards the goals we all share if only we could free their minds from the Establishment Matrix they're trapped in.

I've tried doing this myself, but have yet to succeed. These people will fight tooth and nail to hold on to their bubble reality because it's all the know. I'm just wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to accomplish this goal. Any tips or methods that have worked for you in the past, anything! Each mind that we can free brings us one step closer to our goal, it robs the Establisholes of a slave and makes us stronger at the same time.

Thanks for reading.",bernie,"Suggestions for freeing minds from the Establishment bubble. Hey all, first I hope you'll indulge me for a second. I will get to the point.

* It's very clear that Sanders has the most dedicated following of supporters. Contrary to the narrative that the corporate democrat media wants to tell, Sanders has the most solid following out of all the candidates, and it's least likely for his polling numbers to collapse.
* He is absolutely dominating in the social media game, which means that his message is getting out there despite the media wanting to stop it.
* Bernie is the most liked candidate and he is being pitted against the safe-bet candidate, meaning the best thing we can do is try to dispel of notion that he can't win against Trump, so we should back the ""safe"" candidate who will. Not only did we make that very mistake last time, but it's simply not true that Bernie can't win. He is popular. Take to the streets and shout to the heavens, ""Bernie is popular!""

* It's very clear that Sanders has the most dedicated following of supporters. Contrary to the narrative that the corporate democrat media wants to tell, Sanders has the most solid following out of all the candidates, and it's least likely for his polling numbers to collapse.
* He is absolutely dominating in the social media game, which means that his message is getting out there despite the media wanting to stop it.
* Bernie is the most liked candidate and he is being pitted against the safe-bet candidate, meaning the best thing we can do is try to dispel of notion that he can't win against Trump, so we should back the ""safe"" candidate who will. Not only did we make that very mistake last time, but it's simply not true that Bernie can't win. He is popular. Take to the streets and shout to the heavens, ""Bernie is popular!""
* If you have anymore stats, reply with them and I'll add them to the post."

Let's take an exact transcript of how Bernie answers;
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/transcript-debate.html


&gt;SANDERS:

&gt;I will tell you how we’ll do it. We’ll do it the way real change has always taken place, whether it was the labor movement, the civil rights movement or the women’s movement.

&gt;SANDERS:

&gt;We will have Medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone, that healthcare is a human right, not something to make huge profits off of.

Most people will think that this is a dodge and didn't really answer the question.

I say we take Sanders at his word and look at the answer.

&gt;when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up

What Sanders is referring to without saying the word is the socialist principle called ""solidarity"".

Solidarity ended the government shutdown, when a bunch of aviation workers threathened to strike and shutdown the nation's air travel, Trump caved within 24 hours. https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/government-shutdown-collective-action-strikes-unions

Basically solidarity in action defeated Trump when all the handwaving from the Democrats couldn't do shit.

So for people who are really listening, and this includes the power brokers in industry, what Sanders is saying(without really saying it) is that in order to get his legislative agenda through congress, he is prepared to use the threat of strikes and direct labour action.

For people well versed in socialist ideology, this is clear as day, however many people wouldn't really recognise what Sanders is really saying here.",bernie,"Bernie Cypher: What Bernie is really saying when he answers the question ""How will you get x passed in congress?""

Debate with a bunch of democrats,"I just had a phenomenal experience. I spent about an hour discussing politics with about 8-9 of my close family friends (all 50+). We debated so many things and talked about Healthcare, the minimum wage, money in politics, the endless wars, sexual rights, racial rights, among others.

The discussion started with them talking about how the debates made them want to not vote at all. About how they felt all the democrats were too radical. I stuck to the talking points I've heard for YEARS. How a human being should have the right to Healthcare. How a human being should have the right to an education. How a human being should have a right to racial justice. I stuck to Bernie's message and talking points, and was unrelenting. I am proud to say that after an hour of debate, this group of Biden and maybe non-voters are all with Bernie. They all donated 27 bucks along with myself for a total of 270 to Bernie today.

Stick to the talking points and his message, they speak for themselves. Let's go, #Bernie2020

Black college debt and race based wealth inequality - unsolicited advice to Sanders,"The question of “ what do we mean” when we speak of reparations is important. It is true that economic policies alone won’t end racism. 

However, it is also true that many of the economic debates occurring in the Democratic Party will disproportionately impact black Americans. For example, a raise in minimum wage will have a greater impact on black people like me. 

For these reasons, as a first generation black college graduate, I support Sanders’ legislation and plans for debt free k- college education.

Substantively, Sanders bills would:

* Reduce wealth inequality based on race 
* Desegregate K-college 
* Increase likelihood of black students finishing college, which especially impacts first generation black students 
• provide help regarding black family dynamic where these racist economic forces off mean that my income is also there to sipper other less fortunate members of my family. This is of a large plurality. 
* incentivizing states to control cost in exchange for free education for black students which will make the policies more durable
* Applying it to all makes durable as the black community bejayelinachrvrf with Social Security. Bc the civil rights era happened these popches will impact people of color immediately 
* Focusing on k-college as a right in a modern globalized economy is durable 
* Correct the error of denying black students the full value of a college education just as we were leaving Jim Crow behind 

My one criticism of Sanders is his failure to take the opportunities when he’s had attacked on race to explain what’s in his policies.  

I would also say he is too deferential to bad faith actors who claim to speak for the black community but really speak for the establishment.

While he shouldn’t be aggressive , I believe it’s ok to point out to listeners that his policies will disproportionately help black voters on a level that neither Warren or Harris can complete. He should ask people who denounce him do they disagree. He should also invite black woken to events with people of color to ask them
To tell their stories when the bad faith actors try to shut him down .

He talks too generically. He needs to connect the dots as I’m doing.  Just like he only recently did with Medicare for all by saying people won’t lose their providers.

On education policy for example , I know warren is his grind but he shills explain his program is far more likely to help black communities by leaving more in our community. Warren plan treats a white peoples earning above 100k as if they are the same as a black earner. The only way a racial neutral policy can work that way for people of color is to acknowledge there is wealth inequality between blacks and whites. 

If I’m earning 100k that’s hookah toward paying for the wealth inequality.",bernie,"Black college debt and race based wealth inequality - unsolicited advice to Sanders The question of “ what do we mean” when we speak of reparations is important.

When it comes to talk or ideas or plans, it means nothing when you’re beholden to elite interests, and undecided folks can understand that line of logic.

The number 1 weapon that we have in the battle of opinions is that everyone else is snuggling up to elites and asking corporations for money and appeasing to people who’s interest go against the working/common man.

“Yes she’s good. In fact, I agree with most of what she says. If she’s the nominee I’ll be happy to vote for her vs trump. But it’s disturbing to me that she continuous to fundraise with the wealthy ($2000+ a ticket) and rely on super PAC money. That’s a dealbreaker and it should be for everyone.

Should the Sanders campaign work to generate support in states by showcasing how corporations have benefited from state tax policies over the past few decades?,"Should the Sanders campaign work to generate support in states by showcasing how corporations have benefited from state tax policies over the past few decades?  For Republicans and corporate Democrats, shift the tax burden at the state level to workers is a win-win.  Corporations pay less, and the public becomes sensitized to high taxes and more receptive to pro-tax cut propaganda.  Joe Biden and Republicans likes to talk about states rights when it suites them.

I wish Bernie and his surrogates would quote Dr. King more.,"“Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all God’s children.”

“[W]e are saying that something is wrong … with capitalism…. There must be better distribution of wealth and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.”

“We must recognize that we can’t solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power… this means a revolution of values and other things. We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism are all tied together… you can’t really get rid of one without getting rid of the others… the whole structure of American life must be changed. America is a hypocritical nation and [we] must put [our] own house in order.”

“The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism.”

“You can’t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can’t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You’re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism.”

“If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God’s children to have the basic necessities of life, she too will go to hell.”


These quotes are just the tip of the iceberg, and none of them even touch on how Dr. King believed permanent war was exploitative of poor people all over the globe. I feel like if Bernie is going to be appealing to the democratic socialism of FDR, he should also appeal to the democratic socialism of Dr. King. If Bernie wants to differentiate himself from all the candidates adopting his policies, it could be made obvious that he's the only candidate genuinely able to champion the ideas of Dr. King.",bernie,"I wish Bernie and his surrogates would quote Dr. King more. “Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all God’s children.”

Another way to help Bernie: Become a delegate!,"I made a similar post [back in 2015](https://old.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3j1clf/want_to_help_bernie_become_a_delegate/), thought I'd do this again. 

**Why should I become a delegate?**

To have a greater involvement in our political process! Delegates will select the party nominee at the [Democratic National Convention](https://www.milwaukee2020.com/delegate) July 13 - 16, 2020 at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, WI. You can become a delegate for Sanders, Warren, Harris, Biden, or any other Democrat running. 

**Why would I want to be a delegate for a candidate other than Bernie?**

If a candidate receives less than 15% of the vote in a primary of a proportional delegate state, their share of delegates gets divided among the rest of the candidates that received over 15%. Additionally, at the Democratic National Convention, delegates will vote on the official party platform and can propose amendments. By being there as a delegate (for any candidate) you can vote on the official stances of the party, E.g. prioritizing action on climate change or immigration reform. So whether Bernie is the nominee or not, this is another way to push adoption of more progressive policy.

Also, in the event of a brokered convention, all delegates become officially unbound and can vote for whichever candidate they choose. While unlikely, some think [this may happen in the 2020 cycle](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/caucus/2019/04/24/2020-democratic-primaries-may-not-produce-nominee-brokered-convention-bernie-sanders-joe-biden/3560938002/).  

**How do I become a delegate?**

The process for becoming a delegate will vary from state to state and territory to territory. Some states elect delegates during caucuses, some during primaries, others have completely separate events. Generally, the first step is to submit a statement of candidacy to stand for election as a national convention delegate or alternate. In this statement, identify which candidate to which you pledge your support. It's often more difficult (competitive) to be elected as a delegate for ""front-runner"". Your odds of being elected generally increase by announcing support for candidates polling with lower numbers. 

The delegates elected during this process are called *pledged delegates* because those running voice their support for a specific candidate. Because pledged delegates are not actually bound to vote for that candidate, candidates are allowed to periodically review the list of delegates and eliminate any of those they feel would not be supportive. The process also involves selecting alternates in case there is a need to swap delegates or delegates cannot make it to the convention. 

Find your state or territory below for more information on becoming a delegate. Most of the links are PDFs; a few that I couldn't find are linked to ""The Green Papers"" which generally has some info and will get updated as more info becomes available. If you find any broken or better links, let me know.

If you can occasionally get a group together and make support into a fun event, that's a great way to keep the energy up. Before you read any of it, know that you can always try to be creative, and think of new ways to build support, like how Bernie just started a Twitch channel.

**Here's what you can do for the campaign if you're not a citizen of the US or green card holder:**

* You can't donate or purchase *official* Bernie merch. You can't spend money in support of the campaign, like printing campaign materials with your own money. These are against campaign finance law.
* You can **talk directly to any American friends you have,** even if you only know them online. Talk to them about Bernie, successful social support systems like universal healthcare in your country, etc. Remind them to sign up to vote in the primary ([here are deadlines by state](https://voteforbernie.org/)). Link them to [policy stances](https://feelthebern.org/) and videos showing Bernie's consistency and for-the-people policy like the incredible [""30 Years of Speeches"" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYxZfksAyco). [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FJV0jUeOHw) shows Bernie's incredible rise in 2016, and I've always found [this 2016 introduction speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G4RFH2Qo1E) by Killer Mike to be powerful. More recently, [Nina Turner's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9oj0v6Beo) at the 2020 launch rally was similarly powerful. If they are already supporters, **encourage them to volunteer** and to get involved in communities like this one. Remind them that Bernie is -*the-* candidate not funded by corporations, and that corporate influence is what a large part of makes politics the corrupt game that it is.
* You can **phonebank, textbank**, and do other volunteering like **data entry** or **volunteer support**. [This time and date conversion site](https://www.timeanddate.com/) may become your new best friend. This may be the most impactful thing you can do, but you cannot be paid for it. [Here are the detailed FEC rules for foreigners volunteering.](https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/#Volunteer)
* If you can **code**/**program**, you can check out [**CodersForSanders**](https://coders.forsanders.com/) and their community r/CodersForSanders, which seems to be starting back up for this campaign. Also see **Progressive Coders Network** at the bottom of this post, which is broader than just Bernie.
* You can contribute in a variety of ways (translating, researching, writing, editing, project managing, designing, developing) to the [**FeelTheBern**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/avvg8n/remember_feelthebernorg_well_it_needs_your_help/) website!
* You can **try to recruit other progressives/democratic socialists in your own country** who are available to support Bernie in these listed ways, just like yourself.
* You can see if there's a local [**OurRevolution**](https://ourrevolution.com/groups/) (Bernie-formed) group in your country, and if not, you can form your own! This could be a good way to organize phonebanking parties. At the time of writing this, there are international groups in Vancouver, BC, CA; Edmonton, AB, CA; London, UK; Paris, FR; somewhere in Austria; Seoul, KR; and Tokyo, JP.
* You can **boost Bernie's message** (and those of his great campaign staff and supporters like Nina Turner, David Sirota, Cornel West, Briahna Joy Gray, etc.) on **social media**, in order to spread the word for more supporters. If your country is one of the many with universal healthcare, sharing your experience and lack of worry of losing it can be helpful when many believe it's impossible. You may be able to do similarly with college education prices, which are notoriously outrageous in the US. Commenting on corporate liberal news websites like CNN, MSNBC, etc. may be a way to reach corporate democrat supporters if you have a convincing message for them, but this is probably not too effective (that's my own view).
* You can also **try to reach people in pro-Bernie communities who are already supporters** to encourage them to volunteer. Some people in these subreddits (and facebook, instagram, etc.) are passive supporters who only need a push! I have found this to be effective. If you want to do this, I can give some small tips on how to do it efficiently / as I have been.

**Some alternative choices**:

* You can look into your country's US expat/immigrant community to try to help Sanders supporters there spread the word. Looking into local [DemocratsAbroad](https://www.democratsabroad.org/) may be helpful.
* You can get more plugged into the community by joining the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wvnhQ2B) (from the SFP sidebar), where some online work may get done.
* You can translate relevant wikipedia pages, like the main Bernie Sanders page, which got a good Spanish update in 2016 but may need some more updates.
* If you're interested in his ideas and story, you can purchase Bernie's books and ask your library to order them:

Questions before I take the leap and volunteer! (Iowa),"Long time Bernie fan, Iowan, potential volunteer and first time poster. I have some honest questions relating to Bernie's Campaign strategy/approach, and I figure my fellow redditors can answer at least a few of these. Thank you in advance!

1. Why does Bernie not make a more concerted effort to differentiate himself from the other presidential hopefuls? In ignoring them, he is making Biden the easier target for them, but it also builds up Harris' and Warren's momentum
2. It looked like Bernie treated the debate as just a regular stump speech, giving the same answers from the same approach as he did in 2016. While this is great for confirming his consistency on the matters, that doesn't do much for reaching out to new voters, when his rivals know his 2016 playbook already. What is changing for 2020?
3. Why does Bernie not have a stronger following among African American and Hispanic groups, and what action is he taking on this matter? Were there any missteps I should be aware of?
4. Why did Bernie struggle when it came to talking about gun control and middle-class tax increases? I would have thought he'd have been more prepared to frame his opinion on these subjects by now.
5. Concepts popularized by Bernie were continually referenced throughout the debate, so why isn't he getting more credit? His opponents draw on him like a pool of ideas rather than someone they'll have to defeat to gain the nomination/

Lastly, do you have any recommendations on what information I can familiarize myself with before volunteering, so I can be as well-informed as possible. I remember volunteering in 2016 involved very little training, and I felt uninformed.

I wish Bernie would say something like this in his opening or closing statement in at least one of the debates. I'm not sure how accurate I am so feel free to suggest changes,America was founded on the principles of freedom and equality. But as time has gone by these rights seem to be reserved for the few that can horde wealth and influence. I have made it my life’s work to call out these injustices. As a 21 year old I chained myself to a black student to protest student housing segregation - long before Kamala was being bussed. I started a gay parade in Vermont the year after Buttigieg was born. I led the opposition against the crime bill and the Iraq war that Biden voted for. I started the call for $15 minimum wage when my colleagues on this stage thought it was too high. And today I stand as the only candidate on this stage who believes that every American citizen deserves quality healthcare without being gouged by private insurers. We must protect our inalienable rights but we can only do so when millions of us come together to defend it.,bernie,I wish Bernie would say something like this in his opening or closing statement in at least one of the debates.

"I have a few questions, hopefully you all have the answers.","Hello, I'm currently a Yang supporter but am trying to do my research on the other candidates in the event that my preferred candidate doesn't make it. In the event that he is forced to drop out or something, I need a backup so to speak. There are a few concerns I have regarding Bernie's policies that I was hoping I could get some more insight from you all regarding (I have read all 24 issues pages on his website.)



1: Jobs for all -

""As part of the Green New Deal, we need millions of workers to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure—roads, bridges, drinking water systems, wastewater plants, rail, schools, affordable housing—and build our 100% sustainable energy system. This infrastructure is critical to a thriving, green economy.""

-

My issues is (former) President Obama did something very similar in 2011 with the American Jobs Act - which primary goal was to fund infrastructure rebuilding across america ($50 billion) which was supposed to solve the unemployment problem while simultaneously repairing bridges/roads/levies/etc (which we desperately need still), however, do any of you remember the outcome of that? It didn't work, so my question to Bernie (or any of you all here) is why would it now? If infrastructure isn't the only sector these jobs will be in, what else? Are we talking digging holes to ensure a paycheck or what?

-

2: Fight for Disability Rights - 

""Protect and expand the Social Security Disability Insurance program.""

""Guarantee jobs that pay living wages to all persons with disabilities who want to work through a federal job guarantee program. In addition to the job guarantee, Bernie Sanders will end the sub-minimum wage for individuals with disabilities.""

So, people that are disabled and currently receiving disability often simply cannot work. So what does expand SSDI actually mean (i'm asking for numbers here) and is that all we're offering those that are disabled that simply can't work? The only other solution is a guaranteed job in infrastructure? What does he plan on doing for those too disabled to work in regards to affording food/housing? SSDI in it's current form isn't a livable wage.

""Enact a Medicare-for-all program that includes home-based and community-based care.""

Again, what does this mean exactly? It's too vague, no offense, but Bernie only has 24 items on his website, I hope to be able to expect a little more depth to issues he's deemed important enough to list on his site. Does the medicare for all program strictly refer to medicine? Will hospital/home visits be subsidized or will the families have to pay for that?

-

3: Fair Trade and Workers

""Eliminate the incentives baked into our current trade and tax agreements that make it easier for multinational corporations to ship jobs overseas. Corporations should not be able to get a tax deduction for the expenses involved in moving their factories abroad and throwing American workers out on the street.""

This is where a bit of my background/current preferred candidates idea come into effect. I work in IT, and can see in real time how new advances in machine learning/AI come into play for losing US jobs. Step 1 for companies (especially big tech ones) is to outsource to places like India/Indonesia/etc. Step 2 is is to then replace those jobs with soft/hardware with only a skeleton crew (can be local or not.) even if we force big companies to not do step 1, they will still inevitably go through with step 2. What are we doing to combat that? I make good money as an IT professional, but they are already in the process of replacing my job (and many others) with software suites capable of doing the work of many with very few. My current strategy has been to learn more and rise higher in the skill tier, but it's only a matter of time before the jobs become too few and competition too fierce to be able to keep a job. Is Bernies only plan for automation the guaranteed infrastructure jobs? How does he plan to tackle this problem (and I assure you it is, my best friend is a terrified trucker that wants them to stop progress on AI cars/trucks to keep his job. as well as my wife whom works as a cashier that sees more and more self checkout lanes at her work every few months. It's only a matter of time for many people.)

-

4: My last concern (complaint) is that many of his 24 policies say ""what"" he wants to do, but not ""how"" he wants to do the things he wants to do, good intentions are great, but it's difficult to weigh options with no idea what the back-end to the solution looks like and whether or not I agree with the way he wants to do them.

If any of you have further insight/have heard Bernie answer any of my questions/concerns in an interview or in writing somewhere I would really appreciate getting my hands on it.

How does Medicare for All address 6/10 Americans having preventable diseases,"The CDC outlines this fact very clearly.   [https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm) 

&amp;#x200B;

Medicare for All addresses the skyrocketing healthcare costs, but what about the personal responsibility involved in proactive healthcare?

&amp;#x200B;

I like Medicare for All because it consolidates a healthcare system that is fragmented on how we go about processing and keeping data organized, but does it address the personal responsibility needed to make this truly work?   If the majority of American citizens are diseased and the number is increasing, then the solution must incorporate personal responsibility.  Is that outlined anywhere?  

  
The reason why I bring this up because I think adding in personal responsibility is important to combat the trend of people suggesting that all we are offering is free things to get people to vote for us.  I understand those at the top need to be the first to lead the way and do what is right, but it is still going to take a coalition of poor and middle class to change our lifestyles and I am afraid we too will have to lower our quality of life.   The nuance involved in this problem doesn't make good sound bites, so it makes the problem worse.",bernie,"How does Medicare for All address 6/10 Americans having preventable diseases The CDC outlines this fact very clearly.

Bernie doesn't have the luxury of a slow campaign - he has to go on the offensive,"A bit of a rambling post, but - seeing the wild shifts post-debate, there are several things that are beginning to look clear.

Despite what some might say that ""it's okay, it was only the first debate"", these post-debate changes prove that, perhaps **especially** this early on in the election cycle, while people still aren't as locked in on their candidates, it is of utmost importance to go on the offensive and win major support among those who don't follow politics much out of these major events and news reporting. Bernie can't give a by-the-numbers performance. 

While all of the other candidates (other than Joe) are relatively unknown and have the luxury of building campaigns that slowly introduce them to the public, Bernie has already ran 4 years ago and has major name recognition. him slipping off kills his momentum and allows the media to paint his campaign as irrelevant.

Additionally, while we can try and look at the big picture and say ""oh, there are 7 more months until voting begins, there are 5 more debates until then"" - every debate and every month builds on the one before it. If Bernie had performed better this debate, he could still hold 2nd place or even tie with an even-more-sinking Biden at the top. 

I hope his campaign takes notice of the importance of the debates performance and prepares him better for next time to give more direct and effective answers, and to be more aggressive. He has to make his case in a better way.

The media will and does attack Bernie **ANYHOW** on **anything**. For god's sake, they attack him on him being boring and that he repeats his same messages, attacking him on being consistent. He can't win with them, and I don't understand why he tries and play the game by their terms. 

Look. **When Trump ran in 2015-16, he was aggressive and didn't give a shit about the media and massively won the people's attention and support. When Bernie was more aggressive and urgent in the 2016 Michigan debate he did the same, although it was perhaps a bit too late in the game. When Kamala positioned herself as dominant this last debate and went directly after Joe's head, she changed the entire course of her sinking campaign into practically dragging Biden to the deeps and leaping to the front.** 

It's time Bernie's campaign stops being aggressive only towards Trump and realizes he first has others to win. It's time to start calling other leading candidates on their bullshit. There will always be detractors to that, but this way Bernie establishes dominance. And if the news confront Bernie about it, all he has to say is ""I'm raising issues that the voters need to be aware of about my competitors, that the media sure won't focus on. It's a race, that's the way you differentiate yourself from others, and I didn't hear you blame Kamala when she confronted Joe"". Call the media on their BS to their face. Audiences at large \*do\* appreciate a candidate that does it. Bernie can't play passive anymore, this time he can't play slow. This race contains far more candidates who are willing to go to greater lengths to secure the presidency, he isn't running against 1 candidate anymore, and he has to understand the changing dynamics that come with it.

Why Bernie is actually in a really good position,"I know the recent news has not been ideal, but I'm going to lay out why Bernie is in a better position than people think.

First off poll wise, while Bernie has in a few polls been knocked out of 2nd place and into 3rd or 4th place, the key fact remains that overall he remains in double digits and even the recent polling puts him around 15%.

If that 15% represents his floor, then he's in a good place, as he will remain in the top tier and be in striking position of the lead.

With his rivals we are seeing the standard rise and eventual falling off as the new flavor of the month comes along.

Last few months it was Biden who in command and looking unstoppable and Warren as likely to supplant Bernie.

Now Biden seems to be in decline, and Warren seems to have stalled out, and possibly peaked.

Kamala is now the big name rising, but this only makes her the target for the next few weeks and the next debate.

Better to be strong at the finish rather than peak too early.

Endurance is key, and money is a must for endurance, and while people like Buttigieg and Biden look like they are passing Bernie in that regard, fact is that the pool if big money is limited, and can't support over the long term in a very divided field.

But Bernie has an army of small dollar donations, who can continue to donate, and keep him going well into the fall and the early races, and let him build up a strong infrastructure for those all important early races.

So ignore the noise, focus on the long-term race, the primaries are a marathon and Bernie is in a great position to outlast his rivals",bernie,"Why Bernie is actually in a really good position I know the recent news has not been ideal, but I'm going to lay out why Bernie is in a better position than people think.

Why should I vote for Bernie Over Warren?,"Disclaimer: I’m posting this in good faith. Bernie will likely be the democratic nominee, but I honestly don’t feel the Bern. I’m not trying to debate or troll- I just want to understand him better or see if there is something I’m missing. My mind is open.

Honestly, the arguments I have seen for Bernie haven’t convinced me he’d be the best candidate for the job. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE how progressive he is. And if it was 2016, I would have voted for him. 

But now it’s 2020, and all the candidates have the same platform, and Warren perfects his platform imo with her detailed plans. The fact that he’s been consistent is great, but the fact of the matter is that Warren has been pretty consistent since she’s turned into a democrat. I also haven’t been super impressed by his debate performance, and feel like he gives a lot of platitudes (feel free to argue with this). 

What am I missing? What inspires you so much about Bernie that you don’t see in Warren?

Want to see Bernie at the top of each poll? YOU HAVE TO VOLUNTEER.,"We're all frustrated to see corporate democrats above Bernie despite his decades-long record of fighting on the right side of history, but NOTHING WILL HAPPEN unless you join in on volunteering (donating is good too of course). Each of us has our own experiences that lead us to Bernie's compassionate policies. **If you seriously support Bernie** it's essential not to let this campaign go by without volunteering your time for the campaign. That's what this is about; it's a movement, not a campaign for a figurehead. Textbanking and phonebanking are a great way to start, so [sign up here today and give it a try ASAP](https://act.berniesanders.com/signup/volunteer).

"Bernie's Recent e-mail Survey: Ticking the ""Drawing Contrasts With Other Primary Candidates"" Box Before It's Too Late","Given Bernie's [recent](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/c8ci7v/national_primary_poll_june_28july_1_quinnipiac/) 4'th [plac](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/c8a8mb/iowa_primary_poll_jun_28jul_1_2019_suffolk/)e [polls](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/c7zcht/new_cnn_national_poll_62830_biden_22_harris_17/), and before these polls the other polls dancing between 2nd and 3rd place due to Warren's rise, things have to change. 

It is clear that a large part of this is because Bernie is choosing to compliment his opponents and to soap-box his ideas in debates and on the campaign trail rather than calling out his primary opponents policy records, i.e. he is refusing to call these fakers out for the fakers they are, because he thinks it will help him. 

The reality of the polls is reminding us of a different story, one we've already been through - Bernie tried this in 2015, he [initially tried to be nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrBXcKcviuc) up to early 2016, but eventually [called Hillary's judgement into question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVOg2lz0-2Y), criticized her on [trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF5KjiDdSQM), for [wall street speeches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNVok-nK8js), for [banking votes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdjjH4ZENDg), etc... and it only helped him, for example the astounding Michigan debate + primary win. The point of a primary is to find the strongest candidate not compliment weak candidates whose weaknesses will be exploited by Republicans. 

To cope with this shift, people on this sub are 'insider baseballing' the outsider candidate's strategy like he's following some Machiavellian plan of complimenting while the others go at each other to win in the long run, the reality is (as hopefully these 4th place polls are waking people up to, which was known all along...) that he simply cannot afford a poor showing and if he keeps this up it's not going to go well at all given all the structural disadvantages he faces while the others get to play with house money, this might be the first time ever he has gone in the downward direction this sharply since 2015, and he should be leading the field after all the name recognition he has built up.

There is a question in a very recent e-mail survey from the Bernie campaign:

""**What do you think is most important to winning this primary? Please pick a maximum of three**

- Talking directly with voters about the issues

- Drawing Contrasts With Other Primary Candidates

- Raising money from small-dollar donors

- Giving supporters meaningful ways to get involved

"Do you think that Bernie will attack Kamala's record in the next debate, so she will tank?","According to Real Clear Politics she's getting dangerously close to Bernie and is surging in polls. I'm really afraid she's the actual 2020's Hillary. Not Biden.

Do you think Bernie will attack her in upcoming debates, so he will stop her surging? He didn't do it much in 2016 against Hillary and I think this was a mistake, so this season, he should do it much more.

And we really have a big basket of shit on her: 

She was against legal Marijuana until 5 minutes ago. In 2014! when reporter asked her about this idea, supported by her Republican opponent, she laughed!

She fought, to keep innocent people in jail. 

She locked up parents of truant children. 

She locked up non violent drug offenders. 

She refused to prosecute Steve Mnuchin, when he illegally foreclosed senior citizens from their houses.

She voted against body cams on police officers. 

She voted for civil assets forefiture. 

She is simply female younger version of Joe Biden. To me, she is even much worse than Hillary, because she is demonstrably totally uncaring towards Americans, unlike Hillary, who's record is terrible mostly towards middle east people and her record on working Americans isn't as bad as locking them up for money.

He would make grave mistake for not calling this up. Attacking others worked perfectly for Trump and the most laughable candidate ever won.

I wish anyone would send this to him.

Sanders needs to attack,"Bernie Sanders has the incredible edge of having a pretty static level of support no matter what. This seems to be around 15%ish.

She attacked joe biden for his record, and she jumped like crazy. Specifically, she took joe bidens support from him.Bernie is hesitant to attack anyone because of 2016, I get it.But attacking other candidates allows you to draw important distinctions between you and the attacked candidate.Heck, even pointing out Harris's poor history would do the job if she begins to overtake joe biden. But Bernie has not moved in the polls above the level he needs to show forward momentum. This is very dangerous.

[Discuss] WY coal country is losing jobs. This is a crucial moment to step up to middle America's needs while calling out Trump's hypocrisy.,"https://trib.com/business/energy/two-wyoming-coal-mines-close-send-workers-home-after-bankruptcy/article_773100d1-b5b4-57d8-af49-842518b9e219.html

These coal mines offer high paying jobs to a lot of people with no higher education required. While they are extremely harmful to the environment, these mines are a lifeblood for the state's economy. Although Wyoming didn't stand a chance to turn blue for Hillary, more voters turned out than not because they resonated with Trump's message to protect coal jobs versus Hillary's threat to eliminate coal jobs.

Wyoming will still be a powerhouse for the energy sector, but it will transition from coal to renewables fairly quickly. This change is a threat for a lot of people because it's a change from everything they've ever known for decades. Although Wyoming is a small state, the changes it faces will be seen across the country in upcoming years. West Virginia, Texas, Colorado, Louisiana, the Dakotas, and more are all examples of states that can benefit from a real transition from coal, methane, and natural gas.

Sanders has an excellent track history of reaching out to these blue collar areas and helping resonate a message that protects their jobs with a progressive direction. I'm hoping that the campaign can address something about these mine closures and keep the heat on other candidates by calling out the lies or apathy about this issue.",bernie,"[Discuss] WY coal country is losing jobs.

I’m loosing home in my future... Bernie is really the only hope I got left.,"Hey uh, little nervous to post here. I’m a 22 year old woman in college trying my best to make my dreams of being a creator a reality. My life was pretty rough and still is, and due to my insurance doubling its price for copay I can’t really see my therapist and psychologist anymore as a result. I also just got laid off by my job for a really stupid reason and I lost the first apartment I was going to get. 

I’m struggling to find a loan for college so I won’t have to drop out because I can’t afford it. But just a single small loan will be paid triple what I have to take out because of interest and as a result I’ll be drowning in debt by the time I graduate. I’ve been struggling with diagnosed major depression for the past six years or so and honestly, I’ve been wanting to end it all for a while now, and I still do. Bernie is honestly the only hope I have left for a future as a young adult and honestly if he doesn’t get elected and Trump wins again, I don’t know what I’ll do. 

Him being elected means a lot to me, and it literally makes me want to cry right now because I truly feel that he is the first and only person to truly care about all of us, especially young people. That means so much to me. Someone is finally listening to me- to us.

Current Polling Analysis and Realizations,"Here's my analysis of current polling:

It is likely Biden will continue to plummet. According to Morning Consult, the 2nd pick of 32% of Biden's supporters is Bernie. As he continues to plummet, Bernie will likely catch a hold of those defectors. That amounts to a 10.56% increase, taking Bernie to 29.5% polling and making him the front runner.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's discuss Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren using the RCP average and Morning Consult. According to Morning Consult the second choice pick for Harris supporters is Warren and the 2nd choice pick for Warren supporters is Harris. Anyone that keeps claiming Warren's presence splits lanes is confused, understandably. It is actually safe to assume that her presence in this race is actually beneficial to Bernie, mathematically. Her supporters and Harris supporters keep flip flopping back and forth. There is no consistency like Bernie has. Bernie still keeps holding very steady, with a floor of 15% and a ceiling we can assume of 25%+ if Biden keeps plummeting.

&amp;#x200B;

The goal is for Biden to plummet and for us to scoop up that 1/3 of Biden supporters who claim that Bernie is their #2 pick. Meanwhile Harris and Warren will keep duking it out amongst themselves. Warren is actually threatening the Harris surge. She is actually keeping the establishment down, and few of her supporters will defect to Bernie compared to the amount defecting to Kamala as their #2 choice (27% for Harris, 17% for Bernie)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're wondering about Pete Buttigieg, he is negligible rn, polling at less than 6% and if he was to drop most his support would split between Harris, Warren, and CORY BOOKER, who is polling at like 2-3% rn. Buttigieg is the candidate of losers lmao. I have posted the links to these two polls below. If anyone has any queries regarding my conclusions, please lemme know!

Email Update from Bernie Campaign,"You donated to our campaign this last fundraising quarter, and I wanted to immediately say THANK YOU. I know that we have asked a lot recently. Please know that’s because these emails account for the overwhelming majority of the contributions we receive, and that your support means so much to what we are trying to do on this campaign.

At some point in the next few days, we are going to release how much money we’ve raised and how many contributions make up that amount.

I think those numbers will make you very proud.

When we talk about a political revolution, we are also talking about transforming our corrupt campaign finance system into one that does not require candidates to go around begging Wall Street, fossil fuel lobbyists, and pharmaceutical executives for outrageous sums of money in order to win elections.

And on this campaign we are proving to everyone that if you speak to the needs of working people, young people and the most vulnerable in our society, if you are honest about the need for transformational change and give people a role in making it happen, they will respond.

I am humbled by the kind of support we are receiving, and the incredibly large number of small donations that we have received. You have made it happen.

Thank you for being part of the political revolution.

B&amp;b wins they don't.,"Hard facts that everyone deserves to hear. We need to spread this loud and far. IF Harris wins the nomination, it will be 2016 all over again. Republicans and semi conservatives will attack and vote in droves, while young democrats will be overwhelmingly unintrested to go and vote. Leading to Trump 2020. 

Only 2 candidates I belive can defeat Donald Trump, Bernie and Biden. Biden will make Republican voters see how much of an idiot trump is and sway their vote. While Bernie will make young people have engery and defeat Donald Trump. 

We need one of these candiates to win. Bernie Sanders in my opinion is the best of option for this. If we let someone get the nomination like Harris, we will lose the supreme court when ginsberg dies and be very difficult to fix things. We have 1 shot at this again and elect Bernie as the 46 president.

FDR Had a Quote for the likes of Joe Biden and Other Corporate Dems,"In the century in which we live, the Democratic Party has received the support of the electorate only when the party, with absolute clarity, has been the champion of progressive and liberal policies and principles of government.

The party has failed consistently when through political trading and chicanery it has fallen into the control of those interests, personal and financial, which think in terms of dollars instead of in terms of human values.

The Republican Party has made its nominations this year at the dictation of those who, we all know, always place money ahead of human progress.

The Democratic Convention, as appears clear from the events of today, is divided on this fundamental issue. Until the Democratic Party through this convention makes overwhelmingly clear its stand in favor of social progress and liberalism, and shakes off all the shackles of control fastened upon it by the forces of conservatism, reaction, and appeasement, it will not continue its march of victory.

It is without question that certain political influences pledged to reaction in domestic affairs and to appeasement in foreign affairs have been busily engaged behind the scenes in the promotion of discord since this Convention convened.

Under these circumstances, I cannot, in all honor, and will not, merely for political expediency, go along with the cheap bargaining and political maneuvering which have brought about party dissension in this convention.

It is best not to straddle ideals.

In these days of danger when democracy must be more than vigilant, there can be no connivance with the kind of politics which has internally weakened nations abroad before the enemy has struck from without.

It is best for America to have the fight out here and now.

I wish to give the Democratic Party the opportunity to make its historic decision clearly and without equivocation. The party must go wholly one way or wholly the other. It cannot face in both directions at the same time.

By declining the honor of the nomination for the presidency, I can restore that opportunity to the convention. I so do.",bernie,"FDR Had a Quote for the likes of Joe Biden and Other Corporate Dems In the century in which we live, the Democratic Party has received the support of the electorate only when the party, with absolute clarity, has been the champion of progressive and liberal policies and principles of government.

General discussion of political strategy (not ideology),"Hey guys, I love Bernie as much as the rest of you and would give my left arm to see him elected. That said, I think this sub spends way too much time talking about how great he is and promising donations, when what we should be doing is (ruthlessly) discussing strategy (in a word: how do we get him in the oval office, with a strong enough legislature to enact his policies). Would be great to have a discussion that puts his policies and virtues aside for a second and just discuss ways to get him up in the polls, and be open to all ideas. Before you downvote me, please read with an open mind, and bear in mind that I'm progressive and idealistic as the rest of you, but pure idealism is a graveyard for progressive candidates. The left often seems to act as though tactics were 'dirty', though, (and prefers to assume that their candidate will win whatever strategy is employed). A quick look at history will tell you that that POV is a shortcut to political irrelevance, and it's essential we think about 'what actually needs to be done on the ground' to see the reforms we want enacted, so please read with an open mind.

Some things to discuss:

1. What have we found to be the most effective ways of changing the minds of democrats other than Bernie supporters? For instance, many strong progressives are turning to Biden simply because they think he's the best way of getting Trump out. Any ideas/experiences for how to change their minds? (I think emphasizing how pathetically he performed in the last debate - 'my time is up', 'god bless america', (paraphrasing 'i opposed federal busing') would be one possible avenue.
2. How can we avoid bleeding votes to candidates like Kamala and Pete, who profess liberalism but seem to offer very little in real policy (and in Pete's case, legislative accomplishment).
3. What mistakes did we make in 2016 , and how can we avoid them?
4. How can we raise the flaws of other candidates without causing the sort of backlash we caused in 2016 (particularly with democrats who see Bernie as having scuppered the first female president's chances)?
5. Who should we consider a threat worth trying to counter and who can we safely ignore? Personally I consider Beto to have committed so many stupid gaffes at this point (skateboarding into an auditorium, avoiding a question by replying in spanish) that he's a dead duck. Energy spent on Beto is energy wasted.
6. How can we get Bernie's campaign more exposure in the general media (especially given what looks to me like an intentional attempt to shun him)
7. How can we get any ideas we agree on through to people high enough Bernie campaign that they can become actionable
8. Is negative campaigning really something we want to be avoiding (looks to me like Kamala scored a slam dunk in the second debate, and I'm starting to question this whole 'positive campaign only approach), particularly given the blatant weaknesses in the histories of some of the candidates (Biden: segregation + Bush tax cuts, Pete: total absence of legislative accomplishment and refusal to address racial issues in his home town, Kamala : refusal to prosecute anyone involved in the 2008 crisis like Minuchin, Beto: slave of fossil fuels donors, healthcare deliberately designed to pass itself off as a public option). As a last note, the people pushing hardest for civil politics seem to be centrists like Pelosi and Clinton, trying to quench progressive anger and 'keep the party together' (with themselves at the podium). It seems to me that playing into this narrative might be a huge strategic error. How did Republicans get their agenda through, by 'rising above the fray' or by 'energizing' their most passionate supporters at the grassroots level (remember how effective the Tea Party was?).
9. What's the best way to raise the flaws of other candidates both publically and at a one-on-one level? Should we be aggressive (like Kamala was) or civil (as Bernie currently tends to be)? Note that although Bernie's leading, he doesn't seem to be moving very much, so a change of tone is definitely worth considering. Would Kamala's gains have been Bernie's in the second debate if he'd been the one persuing Biden on his record?
10. Can we decide once and for all whether to forgive Elizabeth Warren for not backing Bernie in 2016? I understand people are angry, but this debate is becoming a huge distraction. (My 2 cents: if we expect perfect records from all allies, we'll end up with no allies. This is politics, she may have had had her own reasons for doubt, and she's on board with Bernie 95% of the way today).
11. What's the best way to channel funds raised? To my mind where Bernie fails colossally is in attracting minority voters (perception of an old white guy who'se been around forever). Rather than just talk about his economic message and risk disregarding that segment altogether (my especially strong fears are of losing LGBTs to Pete, black Americans to Harris, and to suffer generally for identity-politics related reasons - recall Clinton's southern firewall), I think its pretty crucial that campaigning starts to emphasize the fact that a) Bernie was a friend to gay people long before it was fashionable and b) get this image plastered all over the internet non-stop [https://medium.com/@ShaunKing/you-dont-really-know-who-bernie-sanders-was-in-the-1960s-79628016125f](https://medium.com/@ShaunKing/you-dont-really-know-who-bernie-sanders-was-in-the-1960s-79628016125f) to emphasize that as far as civil rights go, nobody's risked more to see progress on the issue.
12. I'm worried that nobody pointed out Biden's military references during the debate. He shouldn't have gotten away with talking about NATO as though it were a vote-winner. The implication of that kind of rhetoric is ever-increasing military spending , escalation of international tensions, and possibly tragic interventionist policies (reminded me of Hillary bringing up Kissinger - should Bernie have called him out on it?) How do we get the message out there that hawkish military rhetoric should be a cause for alarm not a cause for reassurance?
13. Bernie needs new material. The topics are all excellent, but at some point, when you've heard the same sentences unaltered over and over, they starts to pass through your head without provoking an emotional response. Maybe some of us should be putting out ideas for paragraphs Bernie could work into his speeches and if anyone knows people within the campaign we could propose them to the top dog?
14. This will see me downvoted I'm certain, but it has to be said. We should start learning from our enemies.  It's their goals, not their methods we should recoil from. McConnell got his agenda through in under a year by energising his base (Tea Party style) and playing dirty with supreme court justices. If the enemy plays dirty and we play by the rules, I'm sorry to say this, but we're putting ourselves at a huge unnecessary disadvantage. We should be assuming the gloves are off and everything's on the table. Given this fact I don't think we should be above 'fighting dirty' (Hillary's ""When they go low we go high"" had me hitting my head against the wall). Does anyone have any suggestions for novel political tactics we haven't tried before? IMHO the main reason Beto lost to Cruz was that he was trying to wage a lofty campaign about American ideals when he should've been hammering the word 'corruption' home over and over (talk about who the donors are, what their agenda is, which candidates receive what, and give Americans proof that what they think is happenning is in fact happening).  One idea that Cenk from The Young Turks had, for instance, should a debate  happen between Bernie and Trump and the question of abortion or family values be raised, was to raise his sleazy personal life in an effort to erode 'Moral majority"" republican votes: ""Remind me again, when you paid that porn star for sex, was that before or after your wife became pregnant with your child? Oh that's right it was during""
15. Putting aside who we actually like (personally I like Warren and Tulsi as much as the rest of you), given the powerlessness of the VP position, who'd make the best co-candidate to get Bernie the voting blocks that he's currently weak on? The fact that Kamala speaks so passionately and has obvious appeal to minority voters (despite being a corporatist) makes me think she might possibly make a good choice (we could still put Warren in the Treasury and Tulsi in the State Department where they could actually make much more of a difference given their policy interests and excellent ideas.)
16. Any ideas for how a Bernie election could be reinforced by somehow sacking Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein? Those two women have been a complete nightmare for progressives and I see it as pretty essential that we get them out asap.
17. We've got to agree beforehand on whether its ok for Bernie to take PAC money in the general, should he win (otherwise it's going to be a backbiting bonanza when the campaign begins). My answer to this is a definite YES. Absolutely the best scenario is one where nobody takes PAC money at all. But if republicans take it and we don't, they'll win through sheer access to resources (funding in elections dwarfs funding in primaries). We know Bernie's not gonna be bought, so denying him access to this resource strikes me as an own goal.
18. We need to get the message out of liberal enclaves and into southern states that went with Hillary last time. Any ideas for how to do this? (Just my idea: but I was thinking of having a fundraiser to get this image [https://medium.com/@ShaunKing/you-dont-really-know-who-bernie-sanders-was-in-the-1960s-79628016125f](https://medium.com/@ShaunKing/you-dont-really-know-who-bernie-sanders-was-in-the-1960s-79628016125f) of Bernie fighting doggedly for civil rights (even in adolescence) on billboards in places heavily affected by segregation. Actions speak louder than words and that poster said it all really. It also disproves any suspicion that this is a political candidate is like all the others - lots of talk, no actual intent).
19. Should we be publically pushing AOC to endorse? Her approval with democrats is 70%, so it would help Bernie's campaign without a doubt, but research also says it would cost her a lot of support in her own base, which we may need in future during her (hopefully) long career.
20. Bernie's eventual legislative agenda depends on transforming his voter base into grassroots activists that force congress to pass his legislative agenda (in spite of special interests). How can we ensure this transformation materialises in practice (especially given that millenials are notoriously hard to energise politically).
21. I think we should think carefully about the language we use. A lot of the time, we unthinkingly adopt terminology created by the right / corporatists, regardless of its connotation. My biggest pet pieve is 'single payer', which is such a sterile term (reflecting nothing of the ethical foundation behind it, or its massive ramifications socio-economically). 'Universal healthcare' captures the actual ethical basis and the final policy goal. Another example of this is 'climate change', when we could be using much more emotive terms like '(climate-related) ecological catastrophe'. eg 3: 'industrial decline' (do you mean 'working class impoverishment'). 'economic growth' (measured apparently by stock market growth) should be 'wealth divide exacerbation'. 'Tax breaks' should be 'Further tax giveaways' (emphasizing the Bush+Biden tax breaks America's still suffering from, and that these are quid-pro quos to political donors. 'Foreign intervention' should be 'military invasion'. 'Collateral damage' should be 'civilian deaths' or 'infrastructure destruction'. As Bernie pointed out, a 'precision strike' in fact just means 'unprovoked bombing'.
22. One of the biggest things i hear from disillusioned voters is 'why trust any of them?'. We need to find ways of persuading people exactly why Bernie would be different. Some ideas:

* Bernie has a specific plan to accompany all the issues he raises. Pete seems to be offering vague long term intentions and saying 'trust me', which, as we all know means 'I'll feign action, stop as soon as republicans raise an obstacle of any kind, and come re-election time exclaim ""hey - I tried!""
* He has a real record of keeping his word on legislation he promised to push (eg Yemen, unlike, say, Pelosi or Biden)
* Bernie, uniquely, has no incentive to profit from breaking promises, since no corporate donor is backing his campaign and expects no support from the business sector.
* Actions speak louder than words and Bernie's been willing to be arrested fighting the good fight. Can the same be said for Kamala/Pelosi/Biden?
* He speaks the same message regardless of perceptions of popularity (eg allowing the Boston bomber to vote). Nobody who was just in it to be elected would have given that answer.
* Opinions that are popular now were being proposed by him in the 80s when they were literally obstacles to his career (gay marriage, democratic socialism, universal healthcare)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I feel we're missing a lot of obvious ways we could be scoring points, and should be spending more time thinking about strategy. To emphasize I am not saying that we should stop discussing how great a candidate/guy he is (although I imagine we're all agreed on that point).",bernie,"General discussion of political strategy (not ideology) Hey guys, I love Bernie as much as the rest of you and would give my left arm to see him elected.

19. Should we be publically pushing AOC to endorse? Her approval with democrats is 70%, so it would help Bernie's campaign without a doubt, but research also says it would cost her a lot of support in her own base, which we may need in future during her (hopefully) long career.
20. Bernie's eventual legislative agenda depends on transforming his voter base into grassroots activists that force congress to pass his legislative agenda (in spite of special interests). How can we ensure this transformation materialises in practice (especially given that millenials are notoriously hard to energise politically).
21. I think we should think carefully about the language we use. A lot of the time, we unthinkingly adopt terminology created by the right / corporatists, regardless of its connotation. My biggest pet pieve is 'single payer', which is such a sterile term (reflecting nothing of the ethical foundation behind it, or its massive ramifications socio-economically). 'Universal healthcare' captures the actual ethical basis and the final policy goal. Another example of this is 'climate change', when we could be using much more emotive terms like '(climate-related) ecological catastrophe'. eg 3: 'industrial decline' (do you mean 'working class impoverishment'). 'economic growth' (measured apparently by stock market growth) should be 'wealth divide exacerbation'. 'Tax breaks' should be 'Further tax giveaways' (emphasizing the Bush+Biden tax breaks America's still suffering from, and that these are quid-pro quos to political donors. 'Foreign intervention' should be 'military invasion'. 'Collateral damage' should be 'civilian deaths' or 'infrastructure destruction'. As Bernie pointed out, a 'precision strike' in fact just means 'unprovoked bombing'.
22. One of the biggest things i hear from disillusioned voters is 'why trust any of them?'. We need to find ways of persuading people exactly why Bernie would be different. Some ideas:

* Bernie has a specific plan to accompany all the issues he raises. Pete seems to be offering vague long term intentions and saying 'trust me', which, as we all know means 'I'll feign action, stop as soon as republicans raise an obstacle of any kind, and come re-election time exclaim ""hey - I tried!""
* He has a real record of keeping his word on legislation he promised to push (eg Yemen, unlike, say, Pelosi or Biden)
* Bernie, uniquely, has no incentive to profit from breaking promises, since no corporate donor is backing his campaign and expects no support from the business sector.
* Actions speak louder than words and Bernie's been willing to be arrested fighting the good fight. Can the same be said for Kamala/Pelosi/Biden?
* He speaks the same message regardless of perceptions of popularity (eg allowing the Boston bomber to vote). Nobody who was just in it to be elected would have given that answer.
* Opinions that are popular now were being proposed by him in the 80s when they were literally obstacles to his career (gay marriage, democratic socialism, universal healthcare)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I feel we're missing a lot of obvious ways we could be scoring points, and should be spending more time thinking about strategy. To emphasize I am not saying that we should stop discussing how great a candidate/guy he is (although I imagine we're all agreed on that point)."

I would track among other things the e-mails from the Sanders' campaign and their content, trying later to find some patterns in the FEC donations reports.
In order to do this I'd need those e-mail from the campaign's launch up to now, could someone forward them to me? I didn't join the newsletter from the very beginning, unfortunately.

Important info about the WFP (Working Families Party) endorsement process,"WFP endorsed Bernie in 2016 by polling members who signed up - and he won by a LARGE margin.

&amp;#x200B;

As I suspected, this time around they will be doing things a bit differently by using Ranked Choice Voting.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got off the webinar they did with the announcement of how it will work. Here is the rundown

&amp;#x200B;

1) There are 6 candidates they have accepted into consideration based on their response from a survey, history, voting record, etc - Bernie, Warren, Harris, Booker, Castro and (crap - I don't remember the last one now, lol)

&amp;#x200B;

If a person does NOT reach 50% +1 - then it goes to ranked choice! 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway - they will be having a livestream interview of the candidates or surrogates at some point soon - and then on the evening of July 26th they will be hosting interactive debate watch parties - where members/people can chime in and ""fight for their candidate"" - they want people ACTIVELY involved in the process. 

&amp;#x200B;

then they will be having the voting.

&amp;#x200B;

I suggest you follow them on soc media or sign up for text or emails from their website so we can make sure we all get a chance to vote on this- we need Bernie to get over 50% so it doesn't go to rank choice...

&amp;#x200B;

WFP is a huge organizational org- and really big in New York and other places- they worked their butts off for Bernie last time, and I would hate to see him lose this endorsement this time around because we aren't actively participating in the process or paying attention. I also know if they endorse someone else it will not be because Bernie doesn't have the support- but because we didn't activate/get involved.....and man it would suck to see the MSM rubbing it in that they endorsed someone else...(I can hear Chick Todd and Nate Silver now...) 

&amp;#x200B;

So please- sign up for updates (you don't have to donate)  [https://workingfamilies.org/](https://workingfamilies.org/) 

&amp;#x200B;

I will also post a new thread closer to the 26th- and if I get more info

The Media/Establishment has had 4 years to find shady dirt on Sanders. They've found nothing. Bernie can only gain support. Not lose it.,"As much as I trust Bernie to do the right thing, in the back of my mind, I still have to remind myself he's a politician. There is no way he is this clean and pure. It's just so alien to have a politician aiming to be President that is this clean. 

And yet, even the Media/Establishment, who despise him and would probably prefer 4 more years of Trump,  hasn't found anything incredibly damaging on him. 

Aside from hits like ""He'S a SoCiAlIsT"", vacationing in Russia (can someone explain what one to me actually), those tapes from him talking about Cuba/Castro, and tossing ou obscure out of context quotes from years ago,  they have nothing that damages him.

As hard as they try, they can't claim his proposals as impossible anymore when the all the Fauxgressives and Warren have them as ""plans"" for their own campaigns.

Bernie must reach out to more people. His support will not faulter. He just needs to find a way to sap support from Warren, Biden, and Kamala. As they are probably the most likely hurdles for Bernie.

Kamala taking knocking Biden off his pedastal B is a good start.",bernie,"The Media/Establishment has had 4 years to find shady dirt on Sanders. They've found nothing. Bernie can only gain support.

Should we criticize Kamala Harris right now?,"I'm very insure which side to go with. Yes or no. Kamala has already eaten into Biden's, Buttigieg's, O'Rourkes, and Warren's popularity.

It seems like Kamala is splitting the centrist vote. It might come down to Kamala and Biden with less than 20% each. As far as centrists go. If that happens then if Bernie hasn't taken a hit or a bump yet. Then Bernie would only be a couple points under Kamla and Biden. Bernie would go from a distant second. To a close second behind to corporitists roughly tied.

Debate Sanders vs Campaign Sanders,"I just finished watching the New Hampshire rally on twitter and wow I was amazed. Then I realized the reason why I was blown away was because Sanders had the time to lay out his vision, plan, and give us real hope. He needs more time in the debates to be able to explain his ideas and plans, his vision, and why we should have real hope. I think we as a campaign would benefit if more of the 0-1 percent people dropped out so less people are on the stage and sanders can explain it all to the American public. He is such an incredible person and if you listen to the 25 minute speeches he makes it becomes clear that he has the best campaign we will seen come out of 2020. He has a vision of what we have to do and what the issues are. He also has policies that hit all issues. And finally he has the hope that is needed to win a general election.",bernie,"Debate Sanders vs Campaign Sanders I just finished watching the New Hampshire rally on twitter and wow I was amazed.

We meet a machine with a movement,"For those who don't know the title is quote from AOC which i think captures this moment very well.

I have been somewhat disappointed that Bernie hasn't taken the lead in the race (yet). But I've come to the conclusion that his campaign is actually doing very well and I wanted to share my thoughts.

What Bernie has that no one else does is the movement he has build. In terms of volunteers he blows everyone else out of the water and hopefully it will be the same in terms of fund raising in the long run. The reason his campaign has that is because Bernie is awesome let's keep it real but also due to the distributed organizing system his campaign developed back in 2016 and is employing now (Bernie Barnstorms: https://theintercept.com/2019/05/28/bernie-sanders-accidental-organizing-movement-book/ ). This allows the campaign to be a bottom up movement rather than the tradition top down and coverts grassroots energy into real results. They are also doubling down on movement building by directing campaign resources to support striking workers / protecting undocumented immigrants from ICE raid etc. essentially ""not me, us!"".

Then why are polls not reflecting this? Bernie is the biggest threat to those who currently have economic and political power. So the narrative in the MSM will always be unfair to him (even though i think they are being more fair that 2016), contrast with how Beto and Buttigeg were treated and build up by the media. This has a tremendous influence on public opinion. This is the machine which the movement has to beat. 

The way it will happen is that when the organizing starts to pay off, the perception will shift but until it happens it's not going to look good for our cause. Remember AOC was trailing by like 30 points in the polls. She won because her campaign changed who will turn out which is precisely what our campaign will try to do. We can hope that biden's expected decline will favor Bernie in the polls but i think we have to be mentally prepared to go into Iowa without a huge polling lead. That means months of having faith and focusing on building the movement. 

All the establishment has is the power of perception, that Bernie is not doing well or that he cannot win. Wins in the early states will break this perception and there will be a huge shift towards Bernie in the electorate. This is what the campaign itself is aiming for most likely. 

Finally, electing Bernie is not the goal of this movement. It is a tool to achieve the political revolution we need. This movement has to go on to beat Trump, then fight all the corporate power to pass President Sanders's agenda. Bernie lost in 2016 but the movement did not and it changed the party and politics. Even if Bernie doesn't win this time, the movement will. I'm not saying that to be defeatist, as I've argued i think we are on solid ground but I think it's important to see the big picture of change; it doesn't live or die with an election so we should all think long term focus on the movement and not lose faith, big change looks impossible until it happens, this one will be no different.",bernie,"We meet a machine with a movement For those who don't know the title is quote from AOC which i think captures this moment very well.

"As candidates start dropping out, shouldn’t we have a strategy for reaching out to their supporters on social media or in person?","So, we’re going to start seeing more candidates drop off as the race progresses, but I haven’t really seen discussed anywhere what we need to do to bring those supporters over to our camp. While the people most likely to drop out don’t have huge numbers, every little bit counts. 

Some questions I have:

1.	Which candidate’s supporters would most align with our message?
2.	What are some key talking points to bring more of those supporters over?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Is there anything else we could do to help win over some of these primary refugees?",bernie,"As candidates start dropping out, shouldn’t we have a strategy for reaching out to their supporters on social media or in person?

Best way to make student debt cancellation possible?,"Hi everyone,

I attended the webinar today relating to Bernie's student debt cancellation proposal and I was wondering what more can be done on our end in addition to talking to people and getting the conversation out there.

I saw that over 100 academics wrote an open letter to Congress, is that something the average joe could do effectively? Any advice would be appreciated, as I don't have much experience being involved in stuff like this.

Thanks!",bernie,"Best way to make student debt cancellation possible? Hi everyone,

BIG ask from Team Bernie before Sunday deadline!,"*UPDATE 1:30 PM ET: We are still pretty short of our goal! If you chipped in already, THANK YOU! Can you ask 3 friends to do the same? And if you haven't chipped in yet, now is the best time! Thanks everyone. -GP*

*UPDATE 7:30 PM ET: Less than four hours to go!! We've made some progress here but reeaallly need one more big push! -GP*

Hi r/SandersForPresident! We have a really, really big FEC fundraising deadline tomorrow, Sunday, at midnight. We are aiming for a very large number of individual donations, and we're still a bit short of reaching our goal.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s why we’re coming to you directly as some of Bernie’s most loyal, dedicated fans. **We’re asking if this subreddit can bring in 10,000 donations (of any amount) by tomorrow night.** That's a lot of donations! But that is what this campaign is about—bringing people together to accomplish ""unrealistic,"" “radical” goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember we don’t have billionaires or closed-door, high dollar fundraisers, or a super PAC. We have you. And that’s much more powerful! **Donate at or share the link below help us get there.** We’ll provide updates on our progress here on this post whenever we can!

Democratic Debate Proved That Bernie Really Has Transformed the Party,"Nation article [here](https://www.thenation.com/article/democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-kamala-harris-biden/).

&gt; Sanders’s ideas now frame the debate in the Democratic Party—an extraordinary victory for progressives. Even Joe Biden now endorses a $15 minimum wage, tuition-free college, a Green New Deal, and—in reaction to Sanders’s call for Medicare for All—a public option in Obamacare. With Sanders and Warren leading the way, the Democratic candidates are forced to address the glaring, structural inequities and failures of our current system. Biden would prefer a campaign focused on a restoration to normalcy after Trump. But even the moderate Democrats agree there is no going back. Trump is a symptom, not a cause; beating him is necessary but not sufficient. ...  Biden is particularly ill-equipped to deal with the progressive ideas and movements that are driving the debate. The new populist surge—on right and left—arises because of the catastrophic failures of the center that Biden personifies. 

This is an angle that progressives should hit harder.  The Obama/Biden administration *gave us Trump.*  Voters found so little to like about the previous 8 years that they voted massively for a doofus reality show host in a desperate bid to change the nation's course. Biden's nostalgia for the Obama years is a bad thing and risks reverting to a time that much of the population apparently hated. 

&gt; On the second night, in his remorseless fashion, Sanders used his closing to lay down the marker for every candidate: “Nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the military-industrial complex and the fossil fuel industry. If we don’t have the guts to take them on, we’ll continue to have plans, we’ll continue to have talk and the rich will get richer and everybody else will be struggling.”

Why stop with Healthcare???,"I know I am jumping the gun on this, but...

&amp;#x200B;

It's obvious to all of us that healthcare is a right, and medicare should be extended to every single PERSON (not CITIZEN) in this country.  And we seem to be highly attuned to all the things that the corporations are doing to make healthcare worse for everyone - jacking up prices, denying preexisting conditions, discriminating for other reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't see why we just talk about health care.  I know that is the top priority.  But there are lots of other areas that are ESSENTIAL to modern life.  Agriculture and food, internet and telecommunications, transportation, ENERGY (power and heat), even banking and finance.  Access to these is obviously a modern human right.  And yet it seems like many people think that when we are done with health care we should just leave these vital services to the same corporations who extort people in health care?  It doesn't make any sense to me.  

&amp;#x200B;

When can we widen the discussion to include not just Medicare for all, but food for all, internet for all, transportation for all, clean energy for all, banking for all?

Trump capitalism will be poison and how Bernie can take advantage of it.,"Bernie is going to no matter what face calls of socialism, any democratic candidate will in some form face calls of socialism. But only Bernie will be postioned to use it to his advantage. 

Trump will brand himself the capitalist and that is fantastic, it makes direct comparisons easy. What Bernie needs to do is enforce Trump as the face of capitalism let him be their pariah, their symbol. Bernie can point to the tax cuts, the trump healthcare plan, his concessions to the military industrial complex. The corruption and cronyism of his cabinet, his manipulation of the stock market. All of these things are the direct result of an oligarchy allowed to elect a king. 

People will denounce socialism with historical references to tyrants from long ago or to revolutions in Venezuela. But trump is capitalism personified, easy to point to and apparently incompetent. Trump represents the distain for the working man, and the greed of the elite, it's instantly recognizable.

So remember when someone debases Sanders or any democratic candidate for taking a position they deem socialist just say.

I need your help before Sunday's FEC deadline,"Friends, our ideas are winning.

We saw it last night on the debate stage as the discussion focused on issues like Medicare for All, corporate greed, and climate change.

That is because of you. It's because of us.

What we are doing is building an unprecedented grassroots movement that will bring about the transformational change this country needs.

And when we are in the White House, we will have the guts to take on the powerful special interests that control so much of our political and economic life of this country.

I cannot do it alone. We must do this together. We have a new vision for America where health care is granted as a right, seniors can retire in dignity, young people can get the education they need, every job pays a living wage, and climate change is treated as the existential threat that it is.

Our movement is going to transform this country. So before Sunday's FEC fundraising deadline, I need to ask:

**Can I count on you to make a contribution before Sunday at midnight? We've set some fundraising goals for our campaign, and your donation will help us get there.**

My Local Paper Covers Our Bernie Debate Watch Party,"From the piece written by reporter Montana Samuels from *The Pekin Daily Times:*

&amp;#x200B;

 

Not so long ago, putting the words “Tazewell County” and “progressives” in the same sentence would have been oxymoronic.

Pekin’s reputation historically as a “sundown” town and one-time hub of the Ku Klux Klan often precedes itself in conversation.

Now, a Toyota Prius with a “coexist” bumper sticker sits outside of the United Steelworkers Hall on McLean Street in Pekin while inside, a mostly white crowd talks about the appearance of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on the nationally syndicated hip-hop radio show “The Breakfast Club” (the appearance in which host Charlamagne Tha God referred to Warren as [**“the original Rachael Dolezal”**](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/elizabeth-warren-rachel-dolezal-charlamagne)).

What a time.

&amp;#x200B;

Simply by spending less than $100.00 for pizza and pop and sending out a press release, we were able to garner Bernie's campaign some free media.

&amp;#x200B;

There were two political segments tonight that dealt with the debates.

&amp;#x200B;

Sanders did not have a knock it out of the park performance by any means but it had its moments including the only mention of Yemen, a great reply to the ally question by mentioning the oft ignored UN, a diplomatic but definitive rebuke of Joe's Iraq War vote and an impassioned closing statement. Even if you dismiss all that, the mere fact that so many of the candidates - even the more centrist - were espousing positions and talking points that Bernie has been has been at the forefront of for many a year is, in and of itself,  worthy of headlines.  

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention that he is still the candidate besides Joe with the most polling support.

She said bernie sounded like a broken record talking about fighting wallstreet. I explained to her that what bernie is doing is much bigger than him, and how its about us all coming together to support someone with a history of fighting wallstreet. Also how bernie is pretty much saying real change cant happen without us all voting. Also she was unaware that bernie marched in civil rights, and was for gay marriage wayyyyy before it was popular. I know bernie hates identity politics but goddamnit he has been on the right side of history for most of his life. He needs to start touting these things, as this was the thing that I feel really connects most with voters. Bernie is seen as an old white jewish man, and if you didnt know anything about his history then thats all you would know him as. You would assume he isnt about gay marriage, or minorities but his record shows otherwise. IDK why i made this post, but I needed to put this somewhere.

Debate Strategy for Bernie.,"I don't know if his campaign staff monitor these spaces but I hope he sees this.

I'm just gonna get straight to the point.

It's about rising ***BEYOND*** the label of being a Progressive. Right now, he has copycats to deal with &amp; whether they mean what they say or not, the difference is: they say it ***BETTER***. 

&amp;#x200B;

His closing argument about *'plans going nowhere'* is exactly the avenue he ***SHOULD*** have expanded upon the entire night.

""Here's ***WHY*** your plans will mean *NOTHING* with massive corporate influence running rampant.""

""Insurance companies do X, which prevents hospitals from doing Y, and results in customers paying Z."" 

This should have been the ***THEME*** of his responses.   

Corporations do X, X affects people's Y, and people die.

&amp;#x200B;

Educate them on the ***MECHANICS.*** Paint the *Big Picture.*   

&amp;#x200B;

But all he managed was little more than his usual stump speeches. His competition respects him enough not to underestimate him, so they're evolving. He needed to, and he didn't last night. 

Bernie needs to step it up. Personal anecdotes are great but aren't as strong as being *prophetic.* And Bernie is good at prophetic.

""There are videos of me online, 40 years ago, when I began to speak out about the dangerous rise of Corporate power slipping into influential spaces. Look at the world around you now. Does it feel like that has come true? If you agree with me, if you feel as tired as I am with the status quo today, then help me change it.""

The Second Democratic Debate Proved That Bernie Really Has Transformed the Party,,bernie,The Second Democratic Debate Proved That Bernie Really Has Transformed the Party 
Bernie says we need to expose Trump for who he is. I think Trump's not the only one this is true for,"After the debate, I think Bernie has as strong of a chance of winning as ever. However, there is a key mentality *we* need to work on for him so that chance becomes even greater. Bear with me here since this is a little bit of a mouthful:

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that in order for Bernie to win, we collectively need to draw attention to how voters need to realize that the politicians we see and support are not going to completely do the thinking for us and *tell* us exactly what we need/want to hear, and that it is up to us to do some of the rationalization as to why they make sense as a candidate, beyond the initial fervor of a witty retort or contrived catchphrase. We, as a population, need to become more accustomed to choosing our candidates based off of their ideas, focus, drive and plans- not off of the way they act or look. It is here that Bernie can obviously be the strongest candidate, and the establishment and their candidates know that.

I'd like to refer to Pete's statement on Republican 'Christians' (linked at bottom) that's been gaining him, in my opinion, unearned support/traction, and I was surprised to see so much of it coming from Reddit. Now before I continue, I'd like to say that I agree that what he said is true and that isn't what this post is about.

What is alarming to me is the sheer volume of comments purely praising him because he was calm and collected, and thus seemed 'electable' as well as seeming 'safe'. I won't spend much time on this, but will link this famous quote by Martin Luther King Jr. we all know, and that I thought and had hoped that progressives as a whole (the people, not candidates) were starting to understand: [https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/707363-i-must-make-two-honest-confessions-to-you-my-christian](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/707363-i-must-make-two-honest-confessions-to-you-my-christian)

To continue, what got to me in particular are a few very highly rated comments about how even though it was clear his responses were prepared, he presented them in a very genuine manner, and that deserves respect as a candidate for that alone. THIS is part of the problem- if you believe someone may not truly believe what they themselves say they stand for, *consciously acknowledge* this fact, and admit *presentation* can succeed at swaying your vote, you are a major contributing factor to the rise of complacency and inaction in this country, and help establish a false (and damaging) rift between the idea of progressivism/intellectualism and decisiveness.

And going back to the debate itself, we see a similar thought process with Rachel Maddow's ridiculous question aimed at Bernie asking whether he does not support diverse candidates due to his belief that we shouldn't judge people/candidates by qualitative traits. Think about that for a second- they want us to think the concept of supporting (and so not supporting another) a person based off of race, gender, etc. is a positive thing? This is what bigotry is, and literally the source of racism and sexism. Is the bar that low, that we now vote qualitatively rather than quantitatively?

The problems we have to deal with are not simple, and individuals need to realize that the burden of at least putting serious thought and effort into their choices and thought processes is not something that is reserved for the people they see on their TV's. Choosing a candidate based off of their qualitative traits is lazy, and it's incredibly important that we don't allow people who are so close ideologically to Bernie's base to be swayed by the same behaviors and mentalities that led to Trump's victory in 2016. 

Actually putting in the mental effort to properly think through a situation that doesn't directly relate to us on a personal level is hard. But in this day and age, we should hold ourselves to that standard. As a people and as a country, it is that exact ability- to push through that initial resistance to take the easy route- that allowed us to become the place and the ideal that people have striven to be a part of for so long. At the same time, it is the resignation of that effort in good people that have led us to where we are today.

Now, how can we do this?

Where Sanders can (and must) improve,"While I believe that this first round of debates demonstrated the profound influence that Sanders has had on the Democratic Party (which is itself a significant strategic victory), I found Sanders’ individual performance last night slightly underwhelming. Of course the landscape last night (with so many younger candidates jockeying to assume his policy stances) wasn’t as favorable to Sanders as in 2016 (when he had the luxury of contrasting himself with an establishment favorite), and he can probably afford to wait until the field has been whittled down somewhat. Nevertheless, I think that it’s worth considering where he could make (and will arguably need) some improvements moving forward.

1. Connecting the dots between economic and social justice

I believe for the most part Sanders already has the right stances in both of these domains, but too often he fails to synthesize them in a persuasive manner. Like it or not, even if it’s relatively less important in the general election, Sanders needs to do better talking about issues or gender and race if he is going to do win against such a diverse field of candidates. He had a question last night about diversity where he eventually pivoted to attacking Trump’s racism and sexism when he would have better served using that time to make points about systemic discrimination as well as the intersection of race and class.

2. Give his ideas historical context

Like many of you, I thought Sanders was brilliant to draw parallels to FDR, fascism, the Gilded Age, and so on in his latest speech. While the debate format would not permit a full explanation of these issues’ history, I thought Sanders could have benefited from peppering in a couple of analogies and quotes, especially when the moderators raised the specter of “democratic socialism” and how the Republicans would respond to his policy platform. None of the other candidates (other than maybe Warren, albeit to a much lesser extent) are capable of presenting the big picture in such a coherent manner, as all the other candidates either lack the consistent record or the experience that Sanders brings to the table.

Like I said in the introduction, I think these debates were a net positive for Sanders, and unlike many other candidates he can afford to wait until the field thins out a bit and becomes more conducive to his preferred style of debate. That said, I think these are two major areas in which he will need to make improvements if he is to be the Democratic candidate in 2020.",bernie,"Where Sanders can (and must) improve While I believe that this first round of debates demonstrated the profound influence that Sanders has had on the Democratic Party (which is itself a significant strategic victory), I found Sanders’ individual performance last night slightly underwhelming.

Biggest attack on Bernie today is the tired MSM tactic : He will raise your taxes,"They did it last election. It was the first question this debate. It's the only headline on CNN about him. ""Bernie admits he will raise your taxes"".

* Can I contribute with money indirectly, like buying a shirt in the official merch store? Or is that also forbidden for us foreigners?

"Has anyone else here heard of the American Solidarity Fund proposal? If so, what are your thoughts on it?","So the American Solidarity Fund is an idea that was proposed by Matt Bruenig, and you can read the details on it here: https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/social-wealth-fund/

It’s essentially a social wealth fund that collectively owned by American citizens, and equally distributes wealth generated from assets owned by the fund. It’s a form of UBI, but is self-sustaining in the long term, and is funded by actual collective ownership of industry as opposed to a regressive VAT tax like with Andrew Yang’s proposal. To put it another way, the money generated comes from actual collective ownership and control, and isn’t just a monthly allowance provided to us by our corporate overlords.

This is also an idea that has proven to be wildly successful in places like Norway: 

&gt;	Due to its collective wealth funds and soes, the Norwegian government owns around 59 percent of the country’s wealth. To reiterate: 6 out of every 10 kroner of wealth in Norway is owned by the state. When you exclude owner-occupied homes from the calculation, you find that the state of Norway owns 76 percent of the country’s non-home wealth. For comparison, the Chinese government owns only 31 percent of its national wealth.33

&gt;These holdings generate a considerable amount of income. Over the last 10 years, the conservatively-invested gpf-Global generated an average annual return of 5.9 percent.34 Over the same period, gpf-Norway had an 8.3 percent average return.35 In 2017, gpf-Global generated a return 1,028 billion kroner while gpf-Norway had a return of 26 billion kroner.36 In 2016, the soe portfolio produced a 33 billion kroner dividend for the state.37 Adding the 2016 soe figure to the 2017 figures for gpf-Norway and gpf-Global gives you a total return of 1,087 billion kroner or $133 billion.38 Had that money been paid out as a dividend to all 5.2 million Norwegians, it would have provided each with $25,500, or $102,000 for every family of four.

&gt;The Norwegian funds are also efficiently administered. In 2017, gpf-Global’s expenses were equal to 0.06 percent of its assets under management and gpf-Norway’s expenses were 0.07 percent of its assets.39 These expense ratios are near the lowest in the world, even when comparing them to private asset management, and this is despite the fact that the funds are actively managed.

I should also note that this is already somewhat similar to [something Bernie has previously talked about.](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/29/18643032/bernie-sanders-communist-manifesto-employee-ownership-jobs)

Responding to giving healthcare to undocumented immigrants.,"My dad asked me today on how to defend this position to a coworker. This is how I responded and I thought it might be useful to any of you who might encounter this question.


First of all when Bernie Sanders says something he means it. And when he says healthcare is a human right, he MEANS it is a human right and not just an american citizens right. Furthermore, to deny these people entry in our country would be ignoring centuries of white colonial capitalist oppression of indigenous people. These immigrants are most often from South American countries that have been kept in disarray due to US imperial interests. (See Honduras military coup of 2009 backed by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama). The capitalist ruling class for far too long has pitted working class Americans against immigrants. denying immigrants legal status keeps them from unionizing and being able to demand higher wages. It also provides an easy scapegoat for capitalists to place their workers financial woes on. Lastly, borders should be abolished and labor should be free to migrate to where it is needed. If there weren’t a border then they couldn’t ship your factory to Tecate or wherever the f they’re moving it to.",bernie,"Responding to giving healthcare to undocumented immigrants.

Medicare for All Question,"I was doing some research to figure this out, and I couldn't find the answer.  I'm hoping you folks can enlighten me.

I like a lot of aspects about the plan - most fundamentally, the belief that health care is a human right.  I also love idea that people won't feel forced to stay in a job they hate to maintain some modicum of health care coverage and think that benefit isn't discussed enough.

But speaking as someone who has good health insurance from my work negotiated by my union, the company I work for pays a significant amount of my ""total compensation"" towards my health care.  In a MfA scenario, what happens to that money?  Are employers able to simply recapture it for themselves?  Are they required to split the savings with the employee or (best) transfer those savings to the employee?  Or is it unaddressed and will just be up to what you can negotiate?",bernie,"Medicare for All Question I was doing some research to figure this out, and I couldn't find the answer.

Diversity Do-Over,"I thought it might be helpful to start a thread to discuss how to answer the diversity question that Bernie stumbled on last night. 

First, the man's Jewish. Not white. Second, the man is the son of immigrants. Both of those perspectives seem pretty relevant these days. Third, Bernie understood that he had a blindspot when it came to diversity in 2016. Since then, he chose the first Muslim campaign manager in American history, his campaign chairs are predominantly PoC, and 70% of his top campaign staff are women. Diversity matters, representation matters, and Bernie has done the work to address his blindspot. 

Ultimately, Trump aims to divide us up by race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc. Bernie aims to continue the work of Obama, Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., and so many others to create a political revolution of ALL the working class. Black, Latinx, White, Asian-American, Native American, gay, and straight to rise up and say enough is enough. We are sick and tired of the rich and powerful, like Trump, ripping us off. It's time we had a government that represented all of us and worked for all of us not just those at the top.

Bernie has healthcare 100% correct.,"So healthcare is a human right, yes? And In America (purportedly) all citizens have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So, the military protects our right to liberty and the police protect our right to the pursuit of happiness, so it makes sense that the government should protect our right to life with healthcare. It is repugnant that we have allowed people to enrich themselves with the lives of others. We need Bernie for president so that he can dissolve all private insurance companies and enroll everyone in Medicare for All. I am a primary care provider and 90% of my patients are on some form of government funded insurance. In my opinion, they get superior healthcare to the private insurance that I have to pay $230 a month for the pleasure of paying an additional $20 copay every time I bother to see the doctor (which requires a minimum 2 month wait for an appointment). “But how are we going to pay for that healthcare”? 70% marginal tax rate on billionaires.

Joe Pace endorses Buttigieg,"Joe Pace endorses Buttigieg

Seacoast Media Group has learned Buttigieg landed the endorsement of Joe Pace, the 2018 Democratic nominee for New Hampshire's five-member Executive Council.

""Mayor Pete is smart, compassionate, and prepared to handle the complicated challenges facing our country,"" Pace said in a statement.

Pace narrowly lost last year's Executive Council District 3 election to Republican incumbent Russell Prescott of Kingston. Pace, who was born in Portsmouth and moved to Stratham when he was 2, was elected a selectman in Kensington in March's town elections. When Buttigieg headlined a jam-packed town hall in Exeter in May, he was accompanied by Pace, who moderated the event.

The Buttigieg campaign said Pace will help lead the campaign's outreach in Rockingham County, and will serve as an advisor on local government issues, including assisting the campaign's efforts to support municipal candidates this year.[Dems in Seafoadt](https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190708/2020-vision-top-dem-contenders-returning-to-seacoast?template=ampart&amp;__twitter_impression=true)",buttigieg,"Joe Pace endorses Buttigieg Joe Pace endorses Buttigieg

Reparations and compound interest,"Watching Pete discuss reparations at Essence Fest, I'm once again amazed by his ability to express potentially controversial ideas in ways that sound entirely reasonable and intuitive. The standard conservative argument -- ""you can't attribute inferior societal outcomes for black Americans to slavery because it was so long ago"" -- is so easily and sensibly refuted by invoking the concept of compound interest -- that a theft from 150 years ago is exacerbated over time, not mitigated. This seems like an especially effective appeal to, say, small business owners, or other conservative- or libertarian-minded voters who would tend think in classical-economic-theoretic terms. It's moments like this that show the value of Pete's experience working in consulting, and living and governing in a red state. Even if he doesn't get the nomination this cycle, I really hope Democrats across the board can start incorporating this style of speaking and reasoning into their politics.",buttigieg,"Reparations and compound interest Watching Pete discuss reparations at Essence Fest, I'm once again amazed by his ability to express potentially controversial ideas in ways that sound entirely reasonable and intuitive.

It's moments like this that show the value of Pete's experience working in consulting, and living and governing in a red state. Even if he doesn't get the nomination this cycle, I really hope Democrats across the board can start incorporating this style of speaking and reasoning into their politics."

Don't Discount the Impact of the Queer Vote!,"There has been a lot of focus on how Pete needs to win the Black vote in order to win both the primary and the election, and I don't disagree with that at all.

Are there any interviews of Pete talking about his experiences growing up as a gay man/living as a gay public figure?,"This isn't political, and I'm sorry if it doesn't fit this sub, but I couldn't figure out any other place to post this. 

I'm an early-20s bisexual woman who can't come out to her family for fear of repercussions. Even just over my short lifetime, I've seen the attitude and language with which society approaches gay people change so so much, but there's still such a long way to go. 

Last night, I sat down to watch *Brokeback Mountain* (I know I know) and it *profoundly* affected me. There's a scene where one of the characters describes being forced to look at the dead body of his neighbour when the character was only about 9-- the neighbour, who was gay, had been beaten to death with a tire iron. That was in the 50s. In the film, it happens all the way up to the late 80s. I'm sure it's still happening today. 

Pete is brave. He's articulate and educated and compassionate and totally devoted to his wonderful husband. He's so many things we've never seen before or been represented by before in such a visible and public way. It gives me hope in a way I can't really articulate or express. 

All I want in the world is to ask him about his experiences. If only just to know that things *are* getting better and that maybe there's a world in the future where I can be who I am, loudly and unashamed.

2020 Presidential Primary Candidate Survey On Disability,"
Pete Buttigieg’s Responses

“Employment: What are your views on paying a subminimum wage based on disability?

I support repealing Section 14c of the Fair Labor Standards Act. No one in the United States should be exempted from minimum wage laws. This practice is indefensible. In office, my priorities will include increasing opportunities for competitive integrated employment and ensuring that federal agencies are fully committed to the employment of veterans with disabilities.

Assistive Technology: What do you plan to do to increase access to assistive technology for people with disabilities who need it to effectively and independently engage in their communities?

Both mainstream and specialized assistive and adaptive communication/information technologies are instrumental for Americans with disabilities to live normal lives – holding jobs, getting an education, and staying in touch with loved ones. As President, I would prioritize the goal of full digital inclusion across all federal agencies in order to ensure that Americans with disabilities can access all the benefits of technology.

We can achieve digital equity by embracing the use of digital content in education, including ensuring ubiquitous Broadband access at school, home, and within the community. It is imperative that we use America’s ability to lead the world in innovation and technological advancement to improve the lives of all Americans, including those with disabilities.

Special Education: How would you propose to strengthen the IDEA when it is reauthorized so that it truly fulfills its stated purpose of preparing children with disabilities for post-secondary education, employment, and independent living, including children with the most significant disabilities?

I would focus on ensuring that students with disabilities have equal access to all of the educational opportunities that students without disabilities have. This includes implementing both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), expanding access to mental health services for children and adolescents, disrupting the school-to-prison pipeline, and expanding opportunities for competitive integrated employment.

One of my key priorities will be to implement measures for the federal government to consistently meet its funding requirements under the IDEA. The federal government committed to paying 40% of the average per student expenditure for special education with the passage of the IDEA. Since then, Congress has not met that 40% commitment even once. Instead, the current federal funding only covers around 15% of the average per student expenditure. I will work with Congress to provide full funding for the IDEA.

Mental Health Services: What is your vision for a system of services to support people with mental illness?

My vision is to normalize mental health and addiction services by better integrating them into our clinical settings as well as our community settings. Mental health is crucial for our health – it’s also at the heart of many other issues, from opioids and gun violence to decreasing life expectancy. As President, I will invest in prevention, early detection, and treatment of mental health, and make it a priority for my overall health agenda.

To start, I believe that we first must create an actual system of care – one where people seeking mental health care do not have to work so hard to find help. The data is troubling – most people who seek care are not able to receive that care. In 2019, this is unacceptable. We will prioritize investments in mental health services, create comprehensive coverage options so that people can afford care, including mental health care, and create incentives that encourage more robust and tighter coordination of care.

Second, I believe that we must work with our educational system, a key partner in this effort. I will partner with schools, colleges, and universities to educate students on the symptoms of mental illness and provide resources to students at risk. I will ensure that schools and campuses have adequate support for onsite mental health resources and services, and that when possible, we provide onsite trainings so that our students know how to talk to and support each other about these issues.

Third, let’s support our law enforcement officers and jail staff who are often the first responders to individuals who are undergoing mental health crises. I will work with Congress to dedicate additional resources for initiatives to help prevent mental health episodes from reaching a crisis point, including successful models of community-based care, mental health and drug courts, and increasing resources for specialized mental health units in our prisons as well as transitional housing that provides support and treatment upon release.

The opioid epidemic in some ways is symptomatic of a deeper mental health and addiction crisis in our country. We need to increase our efforts to enforce mental health parity laws, encourage medical providers to use team-based approaches to pain, not just rely on prescription opioids when not clinically appropriate, and to increase the number of effective treatment programs for opioid use disorder.

I also believe that we must invest heavily in treating veteran mental health and supporting veterans as they return from overseas and reintegrate back into the community as our fellow citizens, friends, neighbors, and family.

Finally, it is crucial that we work to end the stigma around mental health. This starts with structural elements like ending discrimination at work and in schools. I will focus on ensuring that individuals with mental health needs can access the support and resources they need in a timely manner to live empowered, meaningful lives.

New Hampshire, like many states, has an opportunity to help lead in mental health transformation. Thankfully, it appears that New Hampshire is in the process of bringing forward a more complete vision for mental health and addiction through its 10-year mental health plan, which calls for many items consistent with our approach to mental health and addiction – a focus on access for individuals across the full continuum of care, the importance of remaining local, addressing our mental health workforce problem, and on integrating mental health services.

Workforce Shortage: Please explain how you would address this immediate and growing workforce shortage?

In addition to private insurance policies that have not kept up with the times, there are an unprecedented number of people reaching retirement age in need of in-home-support such as home health aides.

I would work with the private sector to address the critical independent living supports and home and community-based services that many private insurance programs do not cover for people with disabilities of all ages.

Good direct care jobs mean that as we age, we can do so with dignity and care. Moreover, by refocusing our resources on turning care jobs into better jobs, we will reshape our economy while lowering health-care costs. The only way we can get better care for our loved ones, better support for our families, and better jobs for caregivers is by shifting how our culture values care.”

Pete Buttigieg’s Responses

“Employment: What are your views on paying a subminimum wage based on disability?

I support repealing Section 14c of the Fair Labor Standards Act. No one in the United States should be exempted from minimum wage laws. This practice is indefensible. In office, my priorities will include increasing opportunities for competitive integrated employment and ensuring that federal agencies are fully committed to the employment of veterans with disabilities.

Assistive Technology: What do you plan to do to increase access to assistive technology for people with disabilities who need it to effectively and independently engage in their communities?

Both mainstream and specialized assistive and adaptive communication/information technologies are instrumental for Americans with disabilities to live normal lives – holding jobs, getting an education, and staying in touch with loved ones. As President, I would prioritize the goal of full digital inclusion across all federal agencies in order to ensure that Americans with disabilities can access all the benefits of technology.

We can achieve digital equity by embracing the use of digital content in education, including ensuring ubiquitous Broadband access at school, home, and within the community. It is imperative that we use America’s ability to lead the world in innovation and technological advancement to improve the lives of all Americans, including those with disabilities.

Special Education: How would you propose to strengthen the IDEA when it is reauthorized so that it truly fulfills its stated purpose of preparing children with disabilities for post-secondary education, employment, and independent living, including children with the most significant disabilities?

I would focus on ensuring that students with disabilities have equal access to all of the educational opportunities that students without disabilities have. This includes implementing both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), expanding access to mental health services for children and adolescents, disrupting the school-to-prison pipeline, and expanding opportunities for competitive integrated employment.

One of my key priorities will be to implement measures for the federal government to consistently meet its funding requirements under the IDEA. The federal government committed to paying 40% of the average per student expenditure for special education with the passage of the IDEA. Since then, Congress has not met that 40% commitment even once. Instead, the current federal funding only covers around 15% of the average per student expenditure. I will work with Congress to provide full funding for the IDEA.

Pete’s view on Lobbyisrs,"”Buttigieg supports reforming rules on lawmakers jumping to lobbying and he supports the changes in H.R. 1.

Buttigieg also backs a ban on ""golden parachutes,"" substantial benefits given to business executives as compensation when they leave, for those who accept political appointments.

 ""The White House and Federal agencies are not prizes to be won by paid special interests and lobbyists. Yet, that's the atmosphere created by the current Administration. The Mayor believes that to solve the challenges of this century, we need the best ideas from a diverse set of our brightest and most talented people -- not just those who have traditionally enjoyed access, or can buy it,"" a Buttigieg spokesperson told The Hill.

If I could tell Pete one thing.,"It would be to stop talking about raising the minimum wage to $15. Blue collar workers in the south HATE this. I know a lot of hard working people who make in the $13-18 range and when Democratic candidates constantly talk about raising the minimum wage to $15 they just take it as a slap in the face. 

Democratic candidates need to frame the wage increase as something across the board for the lower and middle classes. Our minimum wage is $7.25 here I think. So if we get minimum wage raised to $15.. that guy that makes $18, wants to be making closer to $25. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how do we do this? How do we redistribute wages throughout the lower and middle class until the minimum wage paid is close to $15? This isn't something I have all the answers too but I know it can be done. My employer pays OUTRAGEOUS amounts of money that could be going towards salaries to health benefits.

Policies on Mental Health,"I am concerned that Pete doesn't devote much time or space to mental health.  Most of the results on his policy finder page for ""mental illness"" and ""mental health"" are either completely irrelevant (e.g. tax rates, an important lesson he learned at McKinsey, his age) or mention it in passing as it relates to another issue (e.g. medicare-for-all or LGBTQ issues). 

In one way or another, it's personal to almost everyone: the opioid crisis, increasing instances of teen depression, rising rates of suicide (especially among the demographics who supported Trump in 2016).  I think that the issue not only stands to sway some less consistent democratic voters, but that it is, more importantly, a critical element of the Security and Freedom legs of Pete's platform. 

My partner works as a licensed counsellor (Master's degree level) at a community mental health center, where he makes less than nurses and many public school teachers.  What about therapist burnout or salary?  What about the skills trainers and case managers who make even less, and spend their days travelling around the community trying to make sure that severely mentally ill people get their benefits, go to the doctor, and have food to eat?  I want specific policy proposals, things like how to fund mental healthcare better, housing-first policies, and establishing national licensing standards that would allow therapists to remain in the career more easily.",buttigieg,"Policies on Mental Health I am concerned that Pete doesn't devote much time or space to mental health.  Most of the results on his policy finder page for ""mental illness"" and ""mental health"" are either completely irrelevant (e.g. tax rates, an important lesson he learned at McKinsey, his age) or mention it in passing as it relates to another issue (e.g. medicare-for-all or LGBTQ issues). 

In one way or another, it's personal to almost everyone: the opioid crisis, increasing instances of teen depression, rising rates of suicide (especially among the demographics who supported Trump in 2016).  I think that the issue not only stands to sway some less consistent democratic voters, but that it is, more importantly, a critical element of the Security and Freedom legs of Pete's platform.

"In next debate, will Pete be a target due to fundraising success? And/or should he go on offensive?","We don't have all the fund-raising reports yet (at this time, I haven't seen Beto or Warren's numbers), but since Pete has out-fundraised Bernie, Biden, and Kamala, will he be the focus of attacks in the next debate?

Plus, some of his poll numbers either remained neutral or slipped slightly after the debate, likely due to bumps in Warren and Kamala (and possibly Castro) numbers. Should he go on the offensive, look for more of a ""viral moment""? He didn't have a bad debate at all, but it seems like he didn't gain much from it because the focus has been on other candidates. I hate debates, I wish there were round table discussions instead. The cynical part of myself is now thinking that simply being articulate and having great ideas won't be quite enough; a candidate needs to go on the offensive against another candidate to really stand out, at least in media clips afterward. (He did have the comment against the GOP and religion regarding caring about immigrants, but if I recall correctly he didn't directly attack another candidate).

The next debate (end of July) is the same qualification and format (don't know who's going to be up against who yet) and in September the qualifications will be harder and likely a smaller field.

Student debt or national debt?,"I know the national debt isn't a popular (populist?) topic, but I feel Pete is best placed to appeal to fiscal conservatives simply from a generational point of view. Not only may we be the first generation to be less well off than our parents, but they're still racking up debts - and 'forgiving' student loans merely to add to the national debt doesn't help 40 years from now.

Attacking the GOP on this should be easy but Biden is all too complicit from Obama's term, as are (to varying extents) current senators. Even just to fully fund existing federal programs would be a massive task, and is something the middle class should be willing to pay for. And I think would be willing to with the right leadership. 

I don't think there's any need yet to go after other candidates for their more fanciful propositions on cost while we're still talking values. There's typically only a minority who believe that you can just create trillions of dollars at no cost. But it seems an odd hole on the website to not have anything listed on the economy, given that I know Pete has solid views there. It may not be an ""issue"", and I know climate change is listed along with political change as priorities to be able to implement any agenda, but things need to be affordable.

For the data nerds: Deep dive into the Q1 FEC contribution filings,"I ended up on the FEC website because I read one of Sanders's campaign people saying that they had a donor base of a million people that was consistent from Q1-Q2 filings, and thought it sounded... unlikely. While I was there checking on this (it's not true, just FYI), I ended up checking out a lot of information about Mayor Pete's Q1 donors.

You can download the csv files for all donors on the FEC website, which comes with a lot more information, but I put together a spreadsheet that only shows contributors' city, state, zip code, profession, contribution amount, date of contribution, and dollar amount of total contributions to date. I also searched only by individual contributors, which stripped out all the ActBlue donations, because they often didn't show as much granular information, but you can use the FEC website if you want to see these, too! 

This data is, remember, from two weeks *before* Pete was an official candidate, so the Q2 data will be more revealing, but I did find some interesting discoveries:

* Contributors were far and away in California (1066), New York (743), and, no surprise, Indiana (457) and Illinois (352). What *was* surprising is that the next highest concentrations were found in DC (231), given that he is running against so many established members of the federal government; and Massachusetts (217) and Texas (209), vis a vis Warren and O'Rourke, respectively.
* Aside from ""Not Employed"" at 1,166, the next highest numbers of contributions were tied to the following occupations: attorney (339), physician (165), and lawyer (155). This isn't necessarily individual contributors-- it breaks down by contributions, not by contributor.
* The average contribution amount was $55.67ish. The percentage breakdowns of the donation ranges give the lie to the idea that Pete is the ""Candidate of the Elite"":
   * 7.03%, $1.00 - 25.00
   * 1.95%, $25.01 - 50.00
   * 13.88%, $50.01 - 100.00
   * 47.43%, $100.01 - 250.00
   * 12.50%, $250.01 - 500.00
   * 8.49%, $500.01 - 1,000.00
   * 8.55%, $1,000.01- 4,000.00
   * 0.26%, $4,000.01 - 5,600.00
* Bradley Whitford, Pedro Pascal, Mandy Moore, and unsurprisingly Jane Lynch are fantastic.

Excited to see the numbers from Q2-- when Pete was officially running!-- in a couple of weeks!",buttigieg,"For the data nerds: Deep dive into the Q1 FEC contribution filings I ended up on the FEC website because I read one of Sanders's campaign people saying that they had a donor base of a million people that was consistent from Q1-Q2 filings, and thought it sounded... unlikely. While I was there checking on this (it's not true, just FYI), I ended up checking out a lot of information about Mayor Pete's Q1 donors.

You can download the csv files for all donors on the FEC website, which comes with a lot more information, but I put together a spreadsheet that only shows contributors' city, state, zip code, profession, contribution amount, date of contribution, and dollar amount of total contributions to date. I also searched only by individual contributors, which stripped out all the ActBlue donations, because they often didn't show as much granular information, but you can use the FEC website if you want to see these, too! 

This data is, remember, from two weeks *before* Pete was an official candidate, so the Q2 data will be more revealing, but I did find some interesting discoveries:

* Contributors were far and away in California (1066), New York (743), and, no surprise, Indiana (457) and Illinois (352). What *was* surprising is that the next highest concentrations were found in DC (231), given that he is running against so many established members of the federal government; and Massachusetts (217) and Texas (209), vis a vis Warren and O'Rourke, respectively.
* Aside from ""Not Employed"" at 1,166, the next highest numbers of contributions were tied to the following occupations: attorney (339), physician (165), and lawyer (155). This isn't necessarily individual contributors-- it breaks down by contributions, not by contributor.
* The average contribution amount was $55.67ish. The percentage breakdowns of the donation ranges give the lie to the idea that Pete is the ""Candidate of the Elite"":
   * 7.03%, $1.00 - 25.00
   * 1.95%, $25.01 - 50.00
   * 13.88%, $50.01 - 100.00
   * 47.43%, $100.01 - 250.00
   * 12.50%, $250.01 - 500.00
   * 8.49%, $500.01 - 1,000.00
   * 8.55%, $1,000.01- 4,000.00
   * 0.26%, $4,000.01 - 5,600.00
* Bradley Whitford, Pedro Pascal, Mandy Moore, and unsurprisingly Jane Lynch are fantastic.

&gt;In one, it rose from 38.7% to over 60%; in another, from 47.1% to more than 59%. The third increased from 35.4% to 44.1%. The Census Bureau said there is a relatively large margin of error of 13% to 16% because the sample size in each area is small.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buttigieg’s campaign said the data offers an incomplete picture of the city, where unemployment has fallen and poverty dropped overall since he took office from 27.1% of households to 25% last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The campaign noted the poverty rate for black residents across South Bend fell by more than 6% between 2011 and 2017, compared to a 2.3% decrease nationally. The unemployment rate for African Americans in South Bend decreased by more than 56% during the same period, compared to a 46% drop nationally.  
&gt;  
&gt;The city also has seen five consecutive years of population gain, after years of decline, and median household income has increased since Buttigieg became mayor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buttigieg acknowledged, however, there is more work to be done - both in tackling inequality and earning black voters’ trust. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found no measurable support for the mayor among African Americans nationally.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Jerry Green, an African American who has lived in the West Side since 1978, disagreed with the critical assessments of Buttigieg.  
&gt;  
&gt;Green, 65, said the mayor has frequently visited the area, helped set up a neighborhood watch, provided funds for a local clean-up committee and sent in more police to make the streets safer.  
&gt;  
&gt;He will probably vote for Buttigieg next year.

"Pete mentions ""interdependence"" in his letter today on national service!","I thought I couldn't love him any more, but his latest letter just made my heart grew two sizes bigger. This is my favorite part: "" what has always made America remarkable is not our independence but our **interdependence**."" (See the last paragraph of his letter.) 

I just wrote an article for our local newspaper about this, trying to reframe our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution to be more inclusive (that nature has its rights too), because we are interdependent on the well-being of the animals and plants, the sea and the earth. 

Just donated again! I've never been such an impulsive donor like this but then, you don't see a presidential candidate like Pete very often. And I can't even vote (am an immigrant resident alien)! 

Happy Interdependence Day!

Pete Buttigieg calls for expanding national service,,buttigieg,Pete Buttigieg calls for expanding national service 
Campaign Email: A New Call to Service,"When I was in Afghanistan, I served alongside people from every conceivable background. People who came from the coasts and the heartland, from cities and from farms—people who held beliefs as diverse as our great nation. Some of us had almost nothing in common except the simple fact of being American and in uniform. But the men and women who got in my vehicle didn’t care if I was a Democrat, a Republican, or an independent. They just wanted to get home safe, like I did. 

It was a life-changing experience, and that sense of connection to others is one that young Americans should be able to gain without having to go to war. I believe this can be achieved through national service.

I am proposing A New Call to Service, a plan to dramatically expand service opportunities across the country.

By shaping a new generation bonded by the experience of serving, it will not only deliver good work but also help repair the social fabric in our nation.

Under this plan, we will immediately triple service opportunities from 75,000 to 250,000, targeted towards America’s high school graduates, community college, and vocational students. Eventually, the goal is to expand out-of-state and international service options and quadruple service opportunities—so that they’re available to one million high school graduates by 2026—across initiatives supported by the leadership of a national Chief Service Officer.

Read more on my policy proposal here: www.peteforamerica.com/national-service-plan

Our plan builds on our country’s tradition of national service, which is neither new nor partisan. Until the current administration, every president since 1960 has called upon us to serve. JFK launched the Peace Corps as he challenged us to ask what we could do for our country, George H.W. Bush championed A Thousand Points of Light, and Barack Obama expanded AmeriCorps with the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. My plan—which I’m calling ‘A New Call to Service’—builds upon this tradition to expand service opportunities for Americans.

This announcement is just the beginning. On the trail, we will continue to meet with local service leaders on our campaign stops, and in the coming months we hope you will join us in a National Day of Service, to further root our campaign in an ethos of service.

Tomorrow is our Independence Day. But what has always made America remarkable is not our independence but our interdependence. By strengthening connections between us, we can shape a new generation of America’s youth—linked by mutual experiences with service, aware of the common values that bind us as Americans, and better prepared to come as informed citizens to the table of our democracy.

My First Post Ever: Uplifting Photo And Humble Patriotism Essay: 4TH OF JULY DONATION MATCH-ME IN HONOR OF THE TRUTH THAT “ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL”: Keep The Momentum Going!,"In honor of Independence Day (07/04/1776), match my donation of $7.04 or donate a higher amount of $17.76 (or just donate any amount you want). In honor of the truth that “ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL”, MATCH ME! If you believe in LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and LOVING YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF, MATCH ME!

&amp;#x200B;

If you believe that Pete’s values, policies, and campaign are consistent with the truths that “all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness...”, MATCH ME!

&amp;#x200B;

If you believe that freedom not only means freedom from, but ALSO means freedom to, MATCH ME!

&amp;#x200B;

If you are tired of seeing the weak and vulnerable getting dehumanized and scapegoated, MATCH ME!

&amp;#x200B;

MATCH ME IF YOU BELIEVE IN THESE VALUES: compassion, empathy, liberty, justice, equality, equal opportunity, humility, human worth and dignity, self-sacrifice, serving the least among us, serving those even though they may be different than us, integrity, honesty, charity, love, humble patriotism, perseverance, courage, insight, constructive criticism, responsibility, admitting when you have failed, learning from your mistakes, self-reflection, willing to evolve into better person, service to country, wisdom, temperance, loyalty, forgiving even if not forgetting, respect for oneself and others, hope that the future will be better than today, the never-ending hard-work and dedication needed to bring about a better future, thinking before acting, generosity, kindness, patience, fairness, solidarity.

&amp;#x200B;

Constructive criticism of one’s country and a desire to continually improve it for the well-being of ALL of its citizens is not anti-patriotic! This is HUMBLE PATRIOTISM! Just as no human being is perfect, no country is perfect! Trying to get your country to live up to its best values is not anti-patriotic: this is HUMBLE PATRIOTISM! We should praise strengths, but also admit when there are weaknesses. Just as we love people even though they are always imperfect, we love our country even though it is always imperfect. Because we love our country and its people, we want to improve our country for the people. In order to improve our country, we have to recognize imperfections. This is HUMBLE PATRIOTISM.

&amp;#x200B;

We will not surrender to an arrogant nationalism (fake patriotism) that causes the country to see a false image of itself when it looks in the mirror. When America sees a false image of perfection in the mirror, then it doesn’t see any need for growth. When it doesn’t see any need for growth, then the people of the country don’t get the help that they need and they suffer as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Friendly reminder: Don't get consumed by the negativity.,"Honestly, I get it. I too check social media way too often and tend to get sucked into it, but I feel like some of you might be paying too much attention to all the negative comments that inevitably come when someone runs for president. Should we correct the record if we witness misinformation being spread? Absolutely. Should we be vocal about our reasons to support Pete? Sure. But should we lose our minds about every single poll, negative article or tweet that we find? I don't think that's healthy - neither for us personally nor for this community in general. 

This is in no way supposed to be a personal attack against anyone, just a reminder that positive thinking is important. If Pete manages to win the nomination, there will be even more negativity if you look for it - that's just the way things work unfortunately. This is a marathon, not just for Pete and the campaign, but for us supporters too, and we better make sure we're not already completely exhausted after a few miles. 

So, this is your reminder to take it easy. Breathe, have some water, take a walk. Pet an animal, log off social media, watch a funny movie. If you're not ready to log off, scroll through the ""Wholesome"" posts in this sub. Pete and all of his staff got this, they know which aspects of the campaign still need improving and they are working on it. Let's continue to follow Pete's example by not leaning into the negativity too much and lifting each other up.",buttigieg,"Friendly reminder: Don't get consumed by the negativity. Honestly, I get it.

As we are on the eve of Independence Day (Colonial Ingratitude Day 😉) I am struck by the words of Thomas Paine as we reflect as a nation upon what it means to be proud, or to stand up for those who are in need of disadvantaged or who are struggling in so many ways. I am reminded of Mr. Paine's words from his pamphlet Common Sense: ""These are the times that try men's souls, the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."" 

As we find ourselves reflecting on patriotism this week and weekend, I want to caution my friends here against tearing eachother down or being negative. We have so much to give eachother and share with eachother, we can give everyone of us a better world if we stand and face the world in whatever way it comes.

A Few Reasons Why I'm Supporting Pete,"Here are a few less conventional reasons why I'm supporting Pete and what I think in general makes a good leader/President.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rhetoric:** As much as we like to think policy is key, rhetoric of a candidate is extremely important, if not more important. Donald Trump is living proof. Being able to abstract complex ideas into easily understood messages is a huge asset. Pete's strength with rhetoric is clear via his interviews and his first debate performance. The difference between Pete and Trump is that there's obviously substance and a level of sophistication behind the words Pete expresses. I believe this is a core reason why he's gained so much traction early on, despite being a relatively unknown contender.  In short, he sounds ""Presidential"".  


**National Security/Foreign Policy:** One area the president has considerable power over is national security &amp; foreign policy. Now Pete has addressed the ""forever wars"" and his plans to set higher standards for the deployment of U.S. troops, but putting that aside, the President can still act unilaterally in pushing forward foreign policy objectives. It's my firm belief that any potential Commander In Chief should have extensive experience/knowledge in how to handle and conduct the affairs of the Untied States internationally. Pete's national security background obviously stems from his experience as a Navy Intelligence Officer and serving abroad. [It's also clear he has placed foreign policy at the center of his bid for the presidency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE-r_4x9DFQ&amp;t=1700s). All I'd like now is for him to round out some of his more vague proposals and paint a clear picture of the direction and approach of his administration.  


**He's an Outsider:** Pete, as mentioned before, was a relatively unknown mayor from a medium sized city in Indiana. While some may point this out as a weakness, I believe this will benefit him (and the country) in the long run. Not having deep connections within the party establishment gives Pete more flexibility to operating independently of party influence. Bureaucratic culture is a thing, and while it isn't inherently bad, it does encourage hive mind thinking and rigidity to certain policy proposals. A famous example would be former Obama staffer Ben Rhodes referring to the D.C. foreign policy elite as ""the blob"" due to their near unanimous consensus on how foreign policy should be conducted. Being the outsider, Pete will enjoy the freedom Obama enjoyed early on to chart his own path.

"Grassroot support, policy proposals and poll numbers, a myth ?","I do think it's important to have policy proposals as they tell you why you want to become the POTUS and what you are going to do as POTUS. But in my opinion, having serious policies makes no difference to the electoral appeal. How many of hardcore Warren supporters know the details about her immigration policy ? How many of her fans analyzed how feasible her student debt plan is ? I am sure very very few. Then what explains the Warren surge ? It's the narrative that she has a plan for everything. After languishing in polls  till mid April, Warren suddenly became a top tier candidate after grabbing headlines for being the only politician to take to streets demanding Trump's impeachment when muellers report came out. The press and the media suddenly woke up and she was in news headlines everywhere. It's almost the same time her CNN town hall happened which brought light to her populist policies. ""I have a plan for everything"" meme increased her popularity and poll numbers more than her actual policies. If her policies are so effective then her base wouldn't be women and educated upper middle class voters as polls reveal. Her support should be coming from low income or middle class voters and POC.

Kamala Harris has no signature plan or policies and  so far she herself doesn't know where she stands on Medicare for all, voting rights for criminals or immigration. She didn't have staff in Iowa until last week. It's her calculated and highly rehearsed attack on Biden which gave the media (which till then was waiting for someone to topple the frontrunner for better stories ) a chance to create eye catching and sensationalist headlines. Her theatrical performance was a  perfect fodder for low attention span Americans these days. And voila!. She goes from 8% to 20% in polls ( Even in Iowa). For those who didn't follow elections before, it's the media that created Trump in 2016. Whenever Trump sneezed, everyone in the media caught cold.

I am not saying that it's unfair how much positive attention media is giving them. Not when Pete himself was beneficiary of such attention a few months back. All I am saying is Pete needs to roll out as many policies as possible and have a strong grass root infrastructure in Iowa and NH  but they alone won't move the needle. He cannot go on attacking mode in the next debates either as it is entirely opposite to who he is as a person. What he can do is to prepare himself in the best possible way so that when someone attacks him, his answer should become the main talking point in a positive way. He also needs to frame his answers in such a way that they appeal emotionally to the viewers and at the same time  clearly explain what his stances are.

[Hit Piece Discussion] Why are so many people unable to think about politics rationally?,"Came across this Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/niktaylorde/status/1145709441603514369) where a young man claims he's done 'deep analysis' on candidates we 'shouldn't vote for' (starting with Kamala Harris and Pete) and has 'sources/proofs/receipts'. Majority of the sources are low brow journalism websites, and some of them aren't even sources for the _statement_ that he makes yet he pushes them as such. 

[Example](https://i.gyazo.com/8ec59e36ddf3ff637cdf530f83e6d340.png)

The ""source"" here just links to statistics of South Bend's statistics on racial wealth divide. Pete's name isn't even mentioned. And the thread is full of such ""facts.""

In general, this is my first time following an election this closely, and I cannot fathom how people let themselves be this irrational, playing it as ""my team vs your team."" It's pretty disheartening because it's obvious there is no chance of a rational discussion. I don't know if they're a Bernie or a Trump fan but they definitely have an agenda that they're blindly following.

"Don't Ride The Pollercoaster, or Why This Is All Really Just Survivor Except not on an Island","Before I begin, I'd like to thank CNN for waiting until after Pride Month was over to drop this poll, because that data is homophobic.

Now then: y'all ever watch Survivor? It's still on! CBS, Wednesdays, 8 eastern/7 central. The way Survivor works these days, because ~the game has changed~ is that they start with 18 players divided into two tribes of 9, they vote off three people to get down to 15, and then they tribe-swap into THREE tribes of 5 and it's always supposed to be shocking that's there's three tribes instead of two, but it never is. They vote off like two more people, and then they merge into one big tribe. Pre-merge, you want to keep the big strong dudes around to help your tribe win immunity so you don't get voted off. But after the merge, you want to get rid of the big strong dudes as quickly as possible because they'll win all the immunity challenges.

My point, and I do have one, is this: inevitably, the castaways start scheming to get rid of the big strong guy - let's call him Joe - and someone inevitably ends up as the ringleader of this plot - let's call her Kamala. Well, Kamala gets rid of Joe for being a threat, and then guess what? The castaways are like, ""Kamala's too strong, she's getting too much power, she has to go."" So Kamala, in orchestrating Joe's vote-out, puts a target on her own back. And this cycle repeats itself such that the winner of Survivor is never the person who was the biggest threat at the merge. It's usually some scrawny dude who lays low and watches the threats take each other out.

I think you get the point! We might be on polling's Exile Island right now, but you know what, that's where Jeff Probst puts all the advantages. And we just got a huge advantage by taking in $25 million this quarter! What the polls look like on July 1 is not what they'll look like on September 1, and that's not what they'll look like on January 1, and that's not what they'll look like on the night of the Iowa caucuses, which we are going to win.

Possibly questionable backstories of other Dem candidates VS Pete,"I find it interesting that Pete is facing this extreme vetting on his record as South Bend mayor right now, thanks largely to the shooting, but other candidates aren't.

Biden is the only other one getting a bit of grilling about his past stance on busing, thanks to Kamala's attack during the debates. And he's got more skeletons where that comes from, I'm sure.

Cory Booker's record as mayor of Newark isn't exactly stellar with increases in crime and allegations of being a celebrity mayor who didn't show up:  [https://www.nj.com/essex/2019/02/now-everybody-is-talking-about-cory-bookers-time-as-mayor-of-newark-but-how-did-he-do.html](https://www.nj.com/essex/2019/02/now-everybody-is-talking-about-cory-bookers-time-as-mayor-of-newark-but-how-did-he-do.html)  Bet he had some shootings of blacks by white cops during his tenure.

And Kamala... Lord. Her time as prosecutor in CA has some *real* bad blood, including being a hard ass on incarceration of blacks and a lot of policies perceived by the black community as very unsympathetic.   [https://twitter.com/niktaylorde/status/1145281507449286656?s=21](https://twitter.com/niktaylorde/status/1145281507449286656?s=21)

My point is not to spread bad stuff about the other candidates, but to 1) wonder why Pete is the one getting the laser focus dissection of his record as mayor when he has much less questionable things in his record. And 2) wonder if later on some of these candidates, like Kamala, might have to deal with these things if they get close to the nom.

Not to be exclusive but...,"The next debates at the end of July should have a higher bar for entry. Instead of 1% support in 3 national polls OR getting donations from 65,000 people. It should be the candidates polling in the top 8 or 10. 4-5 candidates per night. You don’t get the chance to go into any great detail on anything in a 10 person debate. I don’t think you can even call that a debate in a traditional sense

Let’s be honest. There are about about 8 people with a chance to get the nomination, and that’s stretching it. They deserve to be heard. And this yelling and interrupting that happened at the June debates made it look like the Democratic Party was not a remedy to the chaos of Trump. It’s bad for the party, and it’s bad for our chances of beating Trump. It results in people choosing to take cheap shots as a means of “having moments”. 

Pete is really one of the only people who rose above the “food fight” in night 2 and did virtually no interrupting. Sure, I’m probably not entirely impartial, but he was the most composed. Even so, you can hardly get to know him in this format, and that’s what the viewing public needs. As people watch Pete, their chances of supporting him skyrocket. However, he’s not the most animated person in the race (not a bad thing), and he doesn’t take cheap shots or interrupt, so he needs time to speak.

One last thing. Can we do away with the audience? They suck up tons of time and more importantly they taint some people’s ability to form their own opinions. Some candidates just say things that they know will be applauded, and it makes them appear more successful than candidates who just state their positions. Do people who host the debates think the electorate is too dumb to decide who “won” the debate without having to measure it by who had the most applause lines!? I’m disappointed to see the format will basically be the same, and I think a lot of people want changes.

**Burn rate: 29.8%**; $31.9 million raised, $22.6 million cash on hand. 22.6 is .708 of 31.9, giving the campaign an effective “burn rate” of spending 29.8% of funds raised across Q1 and Q2 of this year.

Is Pete Buttigieg an establishment centrist neoliberal shill who takes corporate pac money? (A rebuttal I wrote in r/politics),"[I wrote this quick comment in response to some of the criticisms I saw in the Q2 fundraising thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c7qv80/pete_buttigieg_raised_248_million_in_second/esh2s9c/)


No, he doesn't take corporate or lobbyist dollars.

It's true that he's relatively centrist in some of his positions, compared to some of the others in the primary, that is, your Warrens or your Sanders.

For example, instead of making a compulsory transition for all onto a government medicare plan, he's in favour of a public option that will offer a glide path through competition to a single payer system, as he believes a public option would be inherently more efficient and so better for the consumer than private insurance. His plan gives consumers choice and the insurance companies a chance to try and compete, but he believes they'd eventually die off.

Is this more centrist than banning private insurance? Yes, objectively. It's also a much easier sell politically and I would argue better policy.

Let's take a step back though and remember that his platform, compared to all major presidential platforms in the last few decades bar this current race, is the most far to the left. Lets try to keep some sense of historical perspective here.

He also has one of the most realistic theories of the case on how to get his agenda passed. Sanders and Harris have these great policy platforms, but both are against abolishing the filibuster. Bernie is never going to get 60 votes in the senate for medicare for all by way of banning private insurance. This is disqualifying to me, it makes their candidacies fantasies. When the democrats held a brief senate supermajority in 2009, they couldn't even get a public option passed. The ACA in its current form was the compromise. And even the most optimistic 2020 predictions only give the democrats a one or two seat senate majority.

Pete on the other hand has joined with Warren on advocating for abolishing the filibuster. He's also in favour of statehood for DC and PR, giving the democrats a fighting chance of that bare senate majority into the future.

To me the coupling of his relatively (although historically progressive) centrist policy, with his radical approach to legislating makes his candidacy one of the most realistic and honest out there.",buttigieg,"Is Pete Buttigieg an establishment centrist neoliberal shill who takes corporate pac money?

Pete Reference in the Latest Run For Something Email,"
Run for Something
Hi PU18–

One presidential campaign just announced they raised nearly $25 million in the second quarter of this year -- and more are sure to announce as those last-minute June donations get counted and calculated.

I'm thrilled for them. We need a progressive in the White House, without a doubt. But while these campaigns are working for one candidate who will either win the whole thing or go back to whatever they were doing six months from now, we're still pretty far from the $3.3 million we'll need to raise this year to get hundreds of candidates through their election days.

I want a Democrat in the White House, but I also want Democrats running every state legislature where redistricting or abortion access or a hundred critical issues are on the table. I want progressives on city councils and school boards and sheriff's offices. I want every single person in the country to have the chance to be represented by someone who believes that diversity is a strength.

A president alone can't save our democracy. But alongside hundreds of governing partners across the country, they might have a fighting chance.

Today, chip in just $15 (or whatever you can) to make our bench a little deeper with diverse, progressive candidates.

The electability argument,"Pete brought up in his interview with Don Lemon recently that if someone had asked voters in 2007 to come up with the most electable candidate possible, they would not have chosen a black first term Senator named Barack Hussein Obama. Obama proceeded to win in a landslide, and get re-elected despite a competent challenger and an obstructionist Congress.

In my opinion, electability isn't based on being a 45-70 year old straight white man with a long history in governorship or national politics. It's about having the type of charisma and values that appeal to broad swaths of America, and holding policy positions that the majority of Americans agree would benefit them and their families. It's also about drawing a contrast to your primary challengers and general election opponent, while convincing the people that you're the best option.

I don't think most of America will care that Pete is gay, or that he has a horrible last name, or that he's young, or that he's a mayor of a small city. I think what makes him electable is his appearance of honesty, his charisma, his strong family values and patriotism, and his common sense policy positions that he's able to frame in a way that appeals to voters traditionally overlooked by the Democrats.

I'd make the case that Pete is the most electable, due to the physical contrast between him and Trump, and the contrast between their demeanor and values. Pete is young, a highly intelligent polyglot, a veteran, and is willing to take ownership and be honest about not only his successes but his failures. He's also only been married once and often talks about how much he loves Chasten in a way that none of the other candidates talk about their spouses. Trump is in his 70s, can barely speak English, is a draft dodger, and a perpetual liar, adulterer, and probably a sexual assault perpetrator.

I don't think Joe Biden or any of the other candidates would be able to challenge Trump with the humility, intelligence, and icy outrage that Pete is able to channel. Americans shouldn't make the safe choice, we should make the right choice.

Quick Fundraising Guide: EOQ Drives and Stats,"# End of Quarter

In modern business, finances are handled on a quarterly basis (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec); politics are no exception. The FEC - Federal Elections Commission - requires quarterly fundraising reports from Presidential campaigns. Reports to the FEC are public (following a processing period), so every 3 months a campaign's income and expenditures are laid bare for all to see.

Naturally, this situation is conducive to competition. Fundraising is a pretty direct metric of past and future success. More money means you have more supporters giving larger donations, and that money pays for everything: staff, office space, volunteer supplies, event setup, security, travel.

Beyond that, image is everything in politics; good quarterly stats give you momentum, bad stats take it away. Our exceptional $7,000,000 first quarter was a major factor in the frontrunner status we hold today.

**tl;dr campaign quarterly finance reports are public so everyone wants to make them look good**

Some of the most important stats aren't even listed by the FEC; the commission's job is only to provide transparency and accountability, not run statistical analyses. Campaigns run and report their own stats, and they will do so however best benefits them without lying.

# General/Common Stats

TOTAL RAISED: This is the amount raised during that quarter. It does not take into account any expenditures, or any income outside of the quarter.

NUMBER OF DONORS: This is the number of individuals who have donated to a campaign at least once during that quarter. It is not the same as:

NUMBER OF DONATIONS: This is the number of donations a campaign has received that quarter regardless of the number of donors.

AVERAGE DONATION: This is the average amount for a donation received that quarter.

AVERAGE PER DONOR: This is the average amount received that quarter from an individual donor.

BURN RATE: This is the percent of the TOTAL RAISED that was spent.

# Interpretation

It is always important to know exactly what a statistic is measuring. The use of inaccurate or vague terminology can lead to misinformation.

This election cycle, partially thanks to the DNC's debate qualifications, there is an emphasis on low dollar grassroots fundraising. The argument goes that small dollar donations are pseudo-symbolic statements of support; maximizing cash on hand is less important than maximizing the number of people who like you. Makes sense on the surface, but it's led to some statistical... spin. Here are some common issues

DONATIONS PADDING: Encouraging higher-capacity donors to give smaller amounts multiple times (often with recurring contributions). This gives the illusion of grassroots success by lowering the average per donation.

Solution: determine the average per donor by asking for total raised and number of donors.

PERCENT UNDER $X: This phrase is used to represent two different stats, and the average person you're arguing with on the Tweeter won't know the difference. 1) Percent of total number of donations received that are under $x. 2) Percent of total raised that came from donations under $x. The first stat tells more about the proportion of grassroots to high-roller supporters of a campaign and is more easily influenced by donations padding; the second tells more about the campaign's funding sources, and is harder to manipulate.

Keep an eye out for false comparisons if Pete reports that second stat again like he did for Q1

$X IN 24 HOURS: Big bursts of donations are impressive, but they can't sustain a campaign. Like polls, donations reflect an opinion at a specific point in time. All campaigns have highs and lows, but successful ones always have a steady flow of income.

Solution: determine the daily average by subtracting $X from total raised and dividing by 89.

"In today's political climate, Pete needs to go on the offensive in order to seriously contend with Harris / Warren / Sanders / Biden","Pete's temperament is, admirably so, not really geared towards criticizing the other Democratic front runners and will focus almost entirely on his policy and vision.  However, I think those of us who are enamored with his clarity and honesty must recognize that those characteristics will not alone be an effective strategy in order to attract a wider base.  In today's political climate, he MUST be willing to criticize Biden and Harris (who make up the bulk of his most direct potential primary supporters by policy) going forward in debates.  Harris' shaky record on criminal justice as a prosecutor was shockingly not exposed last debate for the general public, and Pete, while not his style, must be willing to go on the offensive against other Democratic candidates if he wants to have a chance in making this a 5-horse race.

I personally loved Pete's response to his handling of the South Bend shooting and his temperament all evening with level headed responses, but at this point in the primary stages, in order to convincingly get committed Biden / Harris voters to switch to Pete's camp he must directly reveal why their past records are problematic and why he is the better Democratic option.

I'm curious what other Pete supporters believe - recent polls aren't everything, but if he continues to poll at around the same numbers as Booker in the 3-6% range while Harris continues to siphon off supporters from Biden as the Top 4 get 14-20% of the base, he might be out of the race much sooner than any of us would like.  Only going on the offensive directly against Biden and Harris, in my opinion, would give him a chance to reach the next echelon and seriously contend for the candidacy.",buttigieg,"In today's political climate, Pete needs to go on the offensive in order to seriously contend with Harris / Warren / Sanders / Biden Pete's temperament is, admirably so, not really geared towards criticizing the other Democratic front runners and will focus almost entirely on his policy and vision.

Pete vs. Kamala,"This is not meant to be a dig at Kamala as I thought she was great and would be wonderful on a ticket with Pete (though I prefer Abrams &amp; Warren), but I think a lot of the discussion about Pete’s ability to build a coalition has been undeservingly negative and short sighted as has the discussion about his debate prospects.

On paper, Kamala is definitely better positioned to build broad appeal in the primaries (though I think Pete can too once more people learn about him), but Pete is reaching voters in the places that republicans need in order to win the general. I think that’s much more valuable in a candidate than getting higher margins in the coastal states which democrats are bound to win anyway. Fortunately, even if Pete doesn’t win the nomination I think that strengthens his case for VP.

With respect to the debates, I think Pete is perfectly positioned. He is maintaining a calm and non-attack oriented strategy which is the right move since it falls in line with his philosophical beliefs and he doesn’t need the new supporters that would gain him as he’s already in line to make the later debates. This will also help him maintain his moral authority going into those later debates which will have less candidates and thus more time for Pete to air out his ideas at greater length. As the election becomes more of a competition for ideas rather than attention, I think Pete’s intelligence, speaking ability, and moral compass will shine in ways that the other candidates just can’t match. As such, I think Pete’s prospects going forward will only get brighter as time passes.

Having said all that, it’s still so early and most people still aren’t even paying attention yet so who knows what challenges Pete will face (i.e. Eric Logan’s shooting) going forward. For that same reason, I also think it’s not worth fretting when other candidates (i.e. Kamala) “win the night” rather than Pete. He still has plenty of time to make his case and it will only get stronger from here.",buttigieg,"Pete vs. Kamala This is not meant to be a dig at Kamala as I thought she was great and would be wonderful on a ticket with Pete (though I prefer Abrams &amp; Warren), but I think a lot of the discussion about Pete’s ability to build a coalition has been undeservingly negative and short sighted as has the discussion about his debate prospects.

The Great Town Hall Speech,"On June 16, 2019 a 54-year old African American, Eric Logan, was shot and killed by Sgt. Ryan O’Neill in response to a police call. One week later a South Bend Mayor in Indiana held a town hall meeting with residents to give his response.

On June 23rd, 2019 
Pete Buttigieg had this to say:

&gt;Let me mention a few things that I think are examples of areas where we can work on together.

&gt;And I would love to hear more, either tonight or in the weeks that are going to come.

&gt;There's several areas where  we know there's a lot of concern in the community. Whether it's a policy, or a practice, or both. That the community may not have confidence in. And that we can invite the community to help us reshape.

&gt;I'll mention six.

&gt;One is **the use of force**.

&gt;There's a written policy on the use of force......is it the right one? Could it be improved? We can have a community process to look at that.

&gt;Number Two, we've talked about this a lot but I'll just mention it briefly, **Cameras**.

&gt;So obviously there is a lot of concern about what it takes to have confidence that body-worn cameras are doing what we intend them to do. 

&gt;The third is **the process of investigating an officer involved shooting**. We've described the process the way that it works. That it goes to Metro homicide, that the prosecutors in charge decide if charges should be filed before any of it goes to the police for discipline.

&gt;*Um....that is NOT the only process we could have*. 

&gt;If there is another process that community members would believe is better, that might lead to more trust, we should explore that. 

&gt;The fourth out of the six is the investigative process, more generally, **when there is a complaint about an officer**. 

&gt;Who do you complain to? 

&gt;How do we determine, if that complaint is valid? 

&gt;There's a process for that we can explain and describe that process, perhaps we can also improve it. 

&gt;The board of safety, the way that works is in the state law but, doesn't mean that that's all there is to the story. 

&gt;There are things we can do before or after or around it.

&gt;The fifth out of the six that I would mention, **is training**.

&gt;Because a policy doesn't mean much if people aren't trained well. It may be the case that there are other things we could do around training. To empower residents to, have a role in how we shape that. 

&gt;And the sixth out of the sixth that I will mention. Again, an area where I will accept responsibility for, the fact that we have not met our goals. 

&gt;Is **recruiting more diverse members of the police department to begin with**. 

&gt;So.....I don't know if the six things are all it would take to deliver trust. But what I will say is those are examples, of very important things in this community, and in policing, that we could work in a collaborative process as a community. 

&gt;To review, and perhaps revise. 

&gt;And if there are others, I promise, that any specific suggestion about an action.......that will increase trust, will be taken seriously.

&gt;I cannot promise that I will, or chief will, or the council will or anyone will all agree, on what the right thing to do is. 

&gt;But I promise that we will find a way, to have community voices heard, to have good ideas taken seriously, and to move in the direction of greater trust.

Ryan O’Neill in response to a police call. One week later a South Bend Mayor in Indiana held a town hall meeting with residents to give his response.

On June 23rd, 2019 
Pete Buttigieg had this to say:

&gt;Let me mention a few things that I think are examples of areas where we can work on together.

&gt;And I would love to hear more, either tonight or in the weeks that are going to come.

&gt;There's several areas where  we know there's a lot of concern in the community. Whether it's a policy, or a practice, or both. That the community may not have confidence in. And that we can invite the community to help us reshape.

&gt;I'll mention six.

&gt;One is **the use of force**.

&gt;There's a written policy on the use of force......is it the right one? Could it be improved? We can have a community process to look at that.

&gt;Number Two, we've talked about this a lot but I'll just mention it briefly, **Cameras**.

&gt;So obviously there is a lot of concern about what it takes to have confidence that body-worn cameras are doing what we intend them to do. 

&gt;The third is **the process of investigating an officer involved shooting**. We've described the process the way that it works. That it goes to Metro homicide, that the prosecutors in charge decide if charges should be filed before any of it goes to the police for discipline.

&gt;*Um....that is NOT the only process we could have*. 

&gt;If there is another process that community members would believe is better, that might lead to more trust, we should explore that. 

&gt;The fourth out of the six is the investigative process, more generally, **when there is a complaint about an officer**. 

&gt;Who do you complain to? 

&gt;How do we determine, if that complaint is valid? 

&gt;There's a process for that we can explain and describe that process, perhaps we can also improve it. 

&gt;The board of safety, the way that works is in the state law but, doesn't mean that that's all there is to the story. 

&gt;There are things we can do before or after or around it. 

&gt;For that matter we could, including different forms of civilian review. And we could even, engage the state about whether the state laws serving us well here in South Bend. 

&gt;The fifth out of the six that I would mention, **is training**.

&gt;Because a policy doesn't mean much if people aren't trained well. It may be the case that there are other things we could do around training. To empower residents to, have a role in how we shape that.

Critical importance of donations before midnight Sunday.,"Second quarter fundraising ends Sunday and it's difficult to overstate its importance.  An exceptionally strong show of force impacts media coverage (some are trying to exclude Mayor Pete from the top tier with Biden, Warren, Harris, Sanders), endorsements, fundraising leaders, staff hires, volunteers, and much more.

Based on past fundraising cycles, the media will focus on three facts:

1. Total amount raised.
2. Total number of overall donors.
3. Burn rate.  (How fast is the campaign spending the money.)

I am encouraging everyone I know to donate $1 or $3 so they are counted (and they begin a fundraising relationship with the campaign).

Contributing any amount is the single best way to ensure the media keeps Mayor Pete in the top tier of candidates.  With so many people calling for a reduction in the number of candidates to be taken seriously, fundraising this weekend is absolutely critical.",buttigieg,"Critical importance of donations before midnight Sunday.

&gt; We've told you that we'll be honest with our goals and transparent with our progress to them, and we hope that you feel like we have done that so far. 

&gt; There’s an FEC deadline tomorrow night, and we need your help. We know that this deadline might seem arbitrary – that a $1 donation today has the same impact as a $1 donation on Monday – and we tend to agree, but here’s why this deadline matters to us: 

&gt; We will have to submit a report of our finances to the Federal Election Commission, and it will be the first time we publicly report on our fundraising efforts since we officially launched the campaign in April. Many folks are waiting to see if we are a serious, competitive campaign before committing their support. 

&gt; This is an important deadline (we wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t) so we’re setting a 24-hour goal of $250,000. Chip in right now and help us reach it before tomorrow night’s FEC deadline.

I've found the video that pin-points why Pete is the candidate for me,"Many people have asked me why I support Pete, sometimes implying he is just a surface level candidate -  an educated and clean-cut politician who speaks well, and that's it. For a while, I had trouble articulating what it is about Pete that makes him the only choice in this Primary for me, but this video  has honed in on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Time stamped: [https://youtu.be/Nldx3r7h3Cg?t=553](https://youtu.be/Nldx3r7h3Cg?t=553)

&amp;#x200B;

The interviewer asks Pete about the tensions between efficiency vs. responsiveness, morality, and mercy (themes he writes about in his book). Pete goes on to talk about executive leadership in philosophical terms and how what is efficient  (and maybe politically expedient) is not always the right thing to do. His answer here is why, for me, Pete would be a wonderful president. Not only do I trust he wants to do the right thing, but he can articulate how difficult that is in a really compelling way. He's not just platitudes.

&amp;#x200B;

He's had some high-visibility moments where he's definitely had to put this into practice - the Boykins demotion, the Eric Logan tragedy, some of the responses to 1,000 houses in 1,000 days (and i'm sure many others that haven't gotten much play in the media). In each of those scenarios, I can see Pete trying to do the right thing, not necessarily the most politically beneficial for him, or the most efficient considering a bottom line.  Especially when you look at 1,000 houses in 1,000 days - he listened to the some members of the black community in South Bend who had issues with the aggressiveness of that program and allocated more dollars to those groups to address their concerns on resources for fixing run-down homes rather than demolishing them. **I see in him someone prepared to balance the scale of efficiency and the lived human experience with compassion and intellect.** In the face of automation and AI - this is so important to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Issues rooted in systemic racism are not some easy thing to ""solve"". Swallwell's knee-jerk ""fire the police chief"" comment was a moment that a lot of people saw as a negative for Pete - but I saw it as an exchange between a man who is trying to come to the right decision (Pete), and a man who would make the politically expedient decision in this political climate (Swallwell). 

&amp;#x200B;

Pete has made great strides in South Bend economically, and on other fronts (though not without their issues, obviously)- that's why he is where he is. If he wasn't a good mayor he would not be getting the support he is getting. I don’t think that should be minimized in the face of the the reckoning that is happening around racial/policing issues in South Bend. But instead of pivoting from those issues and focusing on his successes,which many politicians would have tried to do, Pete is taking responsibility. He's not hiding.

"According to FiveThirtyEight, Pete's pre-debate favorability was 6.7% and after the debates it's now 4.8%.

Won me over from the debates... thats all.,"I would have been very hard pressed if I had to vote for a nominee before the debates. Personally, for me - I was torn equally between Warren, Sanders, Biden, Harris, and Buttigieg. I may not entirely agree with the politics but felt each candidate had their own strengths.

Warren being as detail-oriented as ever and delivering on specific action plans is a refreshing take from the flowery promises typical of politics. But, I can see her being easily villified by the right - the same way HRC was falsely (and successfully) demonized which tragically resulted in pizzagate.

Sanders have a long history of service and activism going all the way back to the civil rights movement. To me, I feel he is probably the most authentic and genuine politician, or at least is perceived to be due to his fiery passion. He seems laser focused on big banks and pharmaceutical companies though. He faces an uphill battle educating voters about Democratic Socialism and de-stigmatizing it.

Biden caters to the nostalgia of the Obama years and touts political experience. For anyone with a passionate hatred of Trump, his laser focused agenda on taking Trump down and nothing else is appealing to some but feels distracted.

Harris I feel might be the strongest orater and debater with enough fire to roast her opponents. Her prosecutor days on doing legal due diligence probably helped develop that skill. Seeing her hold her own against eventual opponents who will be relentless.

But Buttigieg - oh boy, where to begin. I liked Buttigieg before but his debate performance won me over completely. He was the most calm, rational, and practical. In this stage and in prior ones, he showed humility and accountability which is very rare in politics. At times, I felt he was the ""adult in the room"" because of his calm demeanor and articulated responses.

I clapped for his comment about religious hypocrisy and the need of separation between church and state despite being a Christian himself. I haven't seen anyone else with the courage to call this out. But, I am atheist so there is of course some bias there.

Unfortunately, the past few years of division has completely drenched me in pessimism. I just feel America (at least half of it anyway) is still rooted in racism, subconscious sexism, and frankly, homophobia. I don't put it beneath single-issue voters to cast their vote to not see a gay person in the highest office. I don't see the radically religious right allowing it. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how he can overcome this ignorance enough to not just win the nominee but the presidency 

In any case, Buttigieg will officially be the first candidate I have ever donated to in my life.",buttigieg,"Won me over from the debates... thats all.

New supporter!,"Background: I am currently a transitioning senior in high school who is graduating in 2020. Though I live in Arizona, a Republican state, I identify myself as a democrat and have always sorta stayed up to date on recent events and tweets of the democratic party.

It wasn’t until the last couple days when I decided I would really dwelve into the political landscape and tune in to every detail, policy, and strategy of the Democratic party. I have watched both debates multiple times from beginning to end, and I can easily say that *boot edge edge* is my favorite of all the candidates.

I did more research on Pete, primarily checking out his website and browsing this subreddit. I’ve highkey been obsessed with him and, though I don’t have a job and will likely not be able to chip in any money, have heavily promoted him on all my social media accounts. 

I’m so happy and grateful to support the first openly gay man in his journey to president of the United States! Sorry i know this is random, but I just wanted to share my rant of some sort.

Universal HealthCare vs Public Option?,"Pete is for a public option for Medicare vs Universal Health Care (what Bernie is pushing). **Is this enough healthcare reform?** Bernie's plan is labeled ""Medicare For All"" but it is drastically different from the Medicare offered for those aged 65 or older and his plan is essentially free healthcare, eliminating all private insurance.  The current Medicare program as it currently is has its downsides and is not free healthcare. Medicare  offered as a public option might appeal to the sick and uninsured only, it may offer less services and less comprehensive care as funding becomes fickle, or it may be unable to compete with what is currently offered. 

&amp;#x200B;

A question I have about Universal HealthCare is does it still completely cover those who end up having to visit the ER once a week? How can all this be funded? Currently there is a copay in Medicare for each emergency room visit.. but to have it be completely free when each visit can be upwards of $1000s of dollars with no limit ??   I'm unsure how we can consistently fund this ...

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm not sure why other health care reforms aren't being mentioned - eliminating fee-for-service, community health centers, etc America has the most expensive healthcare compared to other countries with no improvements in outcomes. I want to see this addressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the main argument is that Universal HealthCare would never pass through the Senate, but is it possible to create Universal HealthCare via executive order?  I understand there needs to be a transition but 2020 might be time for big changes and massive overhauls rather than slowly chiseling away at issues that aggressively becoming more tragic as we speak.",buttigieg,"Universal HealthCare vs Public Option?

Congrats on an Excellent Debate - Yang Supporter,"Pete had a very good debate, and I just want to congratulate y'all on that. His answer on the religious right was better than Kamala taking on Joe Biden - he called out decades of hypocrisy in a few sentences. Your guy did a good job dealing with the South Bend shooting.

I'd also like to thank a few members of this subreddit for donating to or supporting Andrew Yang over the past few hours. TLDR: Yang's microphone apparently did not work for much of the debate, preventing him from injecting himself into the discussion. Not sure if this was intentional sabotage on behalf of MSNBC or just a technical glitch, but we can't do anything about it now. Yang also only received two questions. Your support in a difficult time for the YangGang shows #HumanityFirst. I'll try and pay y'all back once I cash my next paycheck - Pete deserves it for having a good debate.

It wasn’t the religion part that hit me in the feels, it was the part about putting kids in cages. He showed us that he is authentically not ok with this... emotionally. That look on his face when he talked about what is happening to children at the border: I shivered.  

I know his brain is filled with data and he could talk me into a tornado of economic choice theory, but darn it, I sure do think he has a huge heart.

# 1. This is why we like Mayor Pete: It's not about Trump

Mayor Pete was among the 5 candidates who got to talk the most during the debate nights.  However, he did not mention Trump at all and instead talked about this vision.

# 2. Clearly, the voters responded: Mayor Pete was among the 6 debate winners

Mayor Pete is among the top 5 candidates who got the most Twitter follower within the following 18 hours all **without attacking anyone**.

The two candidates who received more followers are Senator Harris and Former Secretary Julian Castro. Senator Harris received a big bump because of her *attack* on Joe Biden. Similarly, F.Secretary Castro was remembered for his *attack* on Congressmen O'Rouke.

"Just made my first ever political contribution, and it was to Mayor Pete!","Some context, I’m a 19 year old college student who is highly politically motivated. I worked on midterm campaigns, but I obviously wasn’t able to vote in the 2016 elections. I knew I liked Pete up until now, but my goal had always been to help whichever candidate would best trump.

Pete's Debate Performance: The Collected Reviews,"Here's what all the publications are saying specifically about Pete's debate performance last night, both the good and the bad:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Guardian:**

&gt;Three candidates clearly had the energy in the room tonight: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. While the other candidates had their moments, there was no doubt that the applause and focused interest in the room was behind those three.  
&gt;  
&gt;As someone who organizes religious people to vote for Democratic candidates, I found it interesting to hear the enthusiastic and prolonged applause for Pete Buttigieg when he said that the Christian faith calls us to care for kids and not put them in cages and he called out the hypocrisy of the Trump administration. It seemed like an indicator that there is interest and enthusiasm for Democratic candidates who talk about faith.

**CNN:**

&gt;WINNERS  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pete Buttigieg**: If you knew nothing about Buttigieg going into Thursday night, you would have assumed from his performance that a) he was a senator or a governor who had been at this for a long time and b) a co-frontrunner with Harris in the race. That person would be stunned to learn that Buttigieg is currently the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and running at the back of the lead pack. He was serious, smart, thoughtful and probing. His outspokenness on why Democrats need not cede religion to Republicans was powerful. His answer on the officer-involved shooting in his hometown was clearly well rehearsed, yes, but it was about as a good an answer as he could give on such a difficult issue. Buttigieg has lots and lots of natural political ability -- and it shone through on Thursday night.

**The New York Times:**

&gt;**And Now, the Dream of a Harris-Buttigieg Ticket**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Two new Democratic stars outshone Biden and Sanders on the debate stage.*  
&gt;  
&gt;And the answer came in watching Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg — two of the event’s standout performers — run articulate and impassioned circles around him.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;And the sense of a generational divide was acute, partly because Buttigieg, 37, and Eric Swalwell, 38, made sure to highlight it .... A screenwriter friend of mine emailed me midway through the event to say that Sanders resembled “a very angry chess player in Washington Square Park in an undershirt and madras shorts in the summer heat.” He did indeed look steamed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buttigieg didn’t. He has this way — it’s quite remarkable — of expressing outrage without being remotely disheveled by the emotion, of taking aim without seeming armed, of flagging grave danger without scaring the pants off you. He’s from some perfect-candidate laboratory, no?  
&gt;  
&gt;And nobody onstage spoke with more precision and shrewdness, though Michael Bennet came close a few times. Buttigieg said that the God-garbed Republican Party, in its treatment of migrants, “has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.” It wasn’t just a dig; it was a deft reminder of his public fight with Mike Pence over Pence’s vilification of L.G.B.T. people like Buttigieg.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the subject of health insurance, Buttigieg said that sick people “can’t be relying on the tender mercies of the corporate system.” He spoke of China “using technology for the perfection of dictatorship.” Phrases like these came like candies from a Pez dispenser — colorful, sweet and one after the other.  
&gt;  
&gt;And when Buttigieg was confronted with questions about the recent police shooting of a black man in South Bend, Ind., where he is mayor, and asked why the police force wasn’t better integrated, he admitted, bluntly: “Because I couldn’t get it done.” He didn’t make excuses, instead recognizing that between African-Americans and white police officers, “There’s a wall of mistrust, put up one racist act at a time.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Harris had a fire that Buttigieg lacked, and it was mesmerizing .... Imagine a Harris-Buttigieg ticket, and not only what a wealth of poise but what a double scoop of precedents that would be. Plenty of people on Twitter on Thursday night were doing precisely that.

&gt;  
&gt;Those dynamics were on display when Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was asked why his city’s predominantly white police force did not reflect the city’s diversity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buttigieg responded that he “couldn’t get it done,” then expressed unvarnished remorse for [the death of Eric Logan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/back-home-in-south-bend-buttigieg-faces-his-nightmare/2019/06/19/d29c0b50-92bc-11e9-b58a-a6a9afaa0e3e_story.html?utm_term=.8ace622c174c), a 54-year-old black man who died in a recent encounter with a South Bend police officer.  
&gt;  
&gt;“My community is in anguish right now,” he said, as the debate hall grew quiet. “It’s a mess, and we’re hurting.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Buttigieg noted that the officer’s body camera was not turned on, leaving no video of the incident. He said he could have “walked you through all of the things that we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took, from bias training to de-escalation,” to prevent racial bias in policing.  
&gt;  
&gt;“But it didn’t save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother’s eyes, I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back,” Buttigieg said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The comments marked a shift in focus on the second day of the first Democratic debate, during which 10 candidates faced off in wide-ranging discussions about immigration, health care and climate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buttigieg’s initial response to the shooting had disappointed activists and family members of the victim, who criticized the mayor as not showing compassion or offering them information. The controversy underscored tensions between the young, white mayor and the black community in South Bend, where 40 percent of African Americans live below the poverty line.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) challenged Buttigieg on how he should hold police accountable for Logan’s death.  
&gt;  
&gt;“If the camera wasn’t on and that was the policy, you should fire the chief,” he said across the stage in Miami.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buttigieg replied that the incident “will be investigated, and there will be accountability for the officer involved.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“But you’re the mayor. You should fire the chief — if that’s the policy and someone died,” Swalwell said.

**USA Today:**

&gt;Winners:  
&gt;  
&gt;**South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg**  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the past several months since announcing his candidacy, Buttigieg has become a rising star in the Democratic presidential field. But over the past couple of weeks, the South Bend mayor's campaign has [struggled to manage controversy](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/27/democratic-debate-draws-pete-buttigieg-away-from-a-hurting-south-bend/1583886001/) after a police-involved shooting resulted in the death of a black resident in the Indiana city.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the death of Eric Logan, Buttigieg has been criticized for how his administration handled the aftermath of the shooting and race relations in the city more generally. The police department is overwhelmingly white in a city that is 40% black and Hispanic.  
&gt;  
&gt;But during Thursday's debate, Buttigieg managed to turn something that has been a potential liability for his campaign into a moment.  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked about the lack of diversity in the South Bend Police Department, the mayor owned up to his failure.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Because I couldn’t get it done,” [Buttigieg said](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/28/democratic-debate-pete-buttigieg-responds-diminishing-diversity-south-bend-police-force/1592294001/). “My community is in anguish right now.”  
&gt;  
&gt;He went on to say that when he looks in the eyes of Logan’s mother, he has to face the fact that he can’t do anything to bring her son back.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Racial issues**  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of the moments and exchanges mentioned above, issues of racism, race relations and racial justice dominated many of the most notable moments onstage Thursday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;From Harris' tense confrontation with Biden to Buttigieg's confessional acceptance of responsibility, race found its way to the forefront of the night's discussion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper also brought it up, and criticized the country for not doing better at diversifying and implementing new training in police departments to prevent police shootings of black Americans like the one in South Bend Buttigieg has been trying to manage.  
&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Bloomberg Opinion:**

&gt;Buttigieg rose rapidly and proved himself to be polished and thoughtful, but did not do much to defend himself -- even from Swalwell’s criticism of his handling of a police shooting in his city of South Bend, Indiana.  
&gt;  
&gt;....  
&gt;  
&gt;**As far as the rest of the night? I thought Pete Buttigieg probably did what his supporters were hoping for.** Joe Biden had some solid moments, but all that’s going to matter for him is how people are going to read his exchange with Harris, so we’ll have to wait on that as well. I didn’t see anyone else who entered with a plausible chance and who really helped himself or herself. In particular, it’s hard to believe that anyone who wasn’t already in the Bernie Sanders camp was persuaded by his performance, which is the exact same thing he’s been doing since the 2016 primaries.

**New York Magazine / Intelligencer:** \[props to u/nonsequitur7\]

&gt;""Pete Buttigieg has no business being a serious contender for a major party’s presidential nomination. He is the mayor of a university town — and not [an unambiguously good one](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-police-shooting-20190626.html)! The fact that he has galvanized as much media attention and voter interest as he has is a testament to something broken in our democracy.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it is also a testament to the fact that Mayor Pete is conspicuously intelligent and good at public speaking. And Buttigieg used those gifts Thursday night to address a controversy that probably *should* end his campaign — an officer-involved shooting in South Bend that suggests the mayor isn’t necessarily equipped to oversee a small city’s police department, let alone the world’s most powerful national government — in a manner that will probably allow him to keep that campaign going.""

&gt;Because of the moments and exchanges mentioned above, issues of racism, race relations and racial justice dominated many of the most notable moments onstage Thursday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;From Harris' tense confrontation with Biden to Buttigieg's confessional acceptance of responsibility, race found its way to the forefront of the night's discussion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper also brought it up, and criticized the country for not doing better at diversifying and implementing new training in police departments to prevent police shootings of black Americans like the one in South Bend Buttigieg has been trying to manage.  
&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Bloomberg Opinion:**

&gt;Buttigieg rose rapidly and proved himself to be polished and thoughtful, but did not do much to defend himself -- even from Swalwell’s criticism of his handling of a police shooting in his city of South Bend, Indiana.  
&gt;  
&gt;....  
&gt;  
&gt;**As far as the rest of the night? I thought Pete Buttigieg probably did what his supporters were hoping for.** Joe Biden had some solid moments, but all that’s going to matter for him is how people are going to read his exchange with Harris, so we’ll have to wait on that as well. I didn’t see anyone else who entered with a plausible chance and who really helped himself or herself. In particular, it’s hard to believe that anyone who wasn’t already in the Bernie Sanders camp was persuaded by his performance, which is the exact same thing he’s been doing since the 2016 primaries.

**New York Magazine / Intelligencer:** \[props to u/nonsequitur7\]

&gt;""Pete Buttigieg has no business being a serious contender for a major party’s presidential nomination. He is the mayor of a university town — and not [an unambiguously good one](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-police-shooting-20190626.html)! The fact that he has galvanized as much media attention and voter interest as he has is a testament to something broken in our democracy.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it is also a testament to the fact that Mayor Pete is conspicuously intelligent and good at public speaking. And Buttigieg used those gifts Thursday night to address a controversy that probably *should* end his campaign — an officer-involved shooting in South Bend that suggests the mayor isn’t necessarily equipped to oversee a small city’s police department, let alone the world’s most powerful national government — in a manner that will probably allow him to keep that campaign going.""

[Email from Pete] - “50 years after Stonewall”,"Fifty years ago, early on a Saturday morning, police came through the door of the Stonewall Inn. That raid gave rise to a resistance, which in turn helped launch the arrival of LGBTQ consciousness in America as we know it. 
 
My candidacy is possible today only because of the hard work and sacrifice, the literal blood, sweat, and tears, of LGBTQ activists and leaders who worked to create that moment and those that rose up in its aftermath—leaders like Marsha P. Johnson and Silvia Rivera, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, Edith Windsor, and Harvey Milk.
 
The story of Stonewall teaches us that sometimes you’ve got to take a stand and fight back if you want things to change. That was the defiant message of the Stonewall rioters—fed up with abuse by law enforcement and marginalization by society—who responded with fists, beer cans, and even a chorus line. (One protestor, encouraging other New Yorkers to join the riots and perhaps embrace their own sexuality, ran up and down the street slyly shouting, “Come out, come out!”).
 
But the story of equality since Stonewall also tells us that we can’t make change alone. Allies stood at our side, from civil rights leaders to the women’s movement to organized labor, including allies from unlikely places—from the faith community, figures in both parties, and from the American heartland. It’s a reminder that all of us need to stand up for any among us who are targeted for mistreatment, for hate, for disadvantage. Because we never know who will be next if we fail to stand up; and because we never know how far we might move forward when we all do it together.
 
We still have a long way to go, as we are reminded with every LGBTQ young person living on the streets, every trans person killed simply for being themselves, every candle we light to remember those lost while we race to find a cure for HIV and AIDS. So we need to redouble our efforts, working to pass hate crimes laws in every state, enacting a federal Equality Act, and ending the war on trans Americans from the military to the workplace to healthcare. As Chasten likes to say, every pat on the back we give ourselves should serve as a push forward. 
 
Yet as I travel this great country, as I reflect on this momentous anniversary, I am filled with hope. At the beginning of this decade, it was certain in my state that you could either serve in elected office or you could be out, but not both. When I joined the military, it was a matter of law that you could either be in uniform or you could be out, but not both. As recently as a few years ago, in most states, you could be in a same-sex relationship or you could be married, but not both. And today, in that same decade, it is possible for a war veteran and top-tier presidential candidate to campaign with his husband at his side.
 
If we hold fast to that hope—if we take up the unfinished work of achieving true freedom and dignity for every American—then what began half a century ago with broken bottles may yet end with more broken barriers.
 
Thank you,

How many hours of stanning Pete is considered healthy?,"My life is forever changed after watching Pete on the March CNN townhall in April. At first I was just curious. Later,something like hope and calm kept leading me back to YouTube and I clicked and clicked, chasing after another high. Then Youtube was not enough any more. I sought out pod casts, read all the news. (I don't have a TV and am kind of a luddite living on a rural island.) 

Then I signed up for a FB account. Twitter and Google Alerts quickly followed. (Never done social media before!) Now I'm progressing to Reddit. (I'm even learning to use the word ""stan"".) 

Meanwhile, my productivity plummeted. My mood rises and falls with Pete's media coverage and poll numbers. My children are left to fend for themselves, my garden weedy. I read and read and try to join #TeamPete army in spreading Pete's positive messages so much more passionately than I do my own paid work. 

Am I the only one? 

There is no doubt social media is very addictive. But in my case, I'm not sure if it's that or I just fell head over heels for Pete. Is this an act of hope or merely an addiction or obsession? 

Perhaps I need a Pete rehab? Sigh!",buttigieg,"How many hours of stanning Pete is considered healthy? My life is forever changed after watching Pete on the March CNN townhall in April.

One important thing last night showed: Pete's anger,"I've heard several people talk about how they thought Pete was cold, or bland, because he doesn't yell or raise his voice about things--the whole ""if you aren't angry you aren't paying attention"" idea.  

I think that last night we got to see that Pete is indeed furious about what is happening, particularly on the clip regarding family separation.  That, and of course the infamous Swalwell Death Glare, shows that Pete is able to express anger in a calm but forceful way--an anger that demands attention but doesn't overwhelm rationality.  

Imagine Pete in a meeting with Putin with that look in his eye and that tone in his voice...

#A Brief Bio of Pete Buttigieg
Pete belongs to the generation that came of age with school shootings, the generation that provided the majority of the troops in the conflicts after 9/11, the generation that is on the business end of climate change, and the generation that—unless we take action—stands to be the first to be worse off economically than their parents. 

Pete is laying out a vision, values, and policies to ensure that America’s future is better than its past. We need to secure a future in which every American has the freedom to live a life of their choosing; where our republic grows more and not less democratic; where racial justice is a reality and not a dream; where we’ve put an end to endless war; where we’ve summoned the national will to meet the challenge of climate change; where everyone has the health care they need; and where everyone has the chance to find purpose and belonging in our economy and our country.

If the Democrats nominate Pete, he has my vote!","Edit: I just have to say the level of healthy discussion in this thread about opposing political views is the most civil I’ve ever seen on a political subreddit. I’m definitely in good company here :)

Edit 2: I hope some of my comments helped shed some light on the reasons why myself, and many others, ended up feeling the need to vote for Trump in the last election. We're not all terrible people, some of us are just normal Americans who were upset with the alternative option and felt betrayed. Overall, looking towards the future, I'm glad we've found a candidate we can get behind, who has a clean record, and is a fantastic speaker. I look forward to seeing how Pete progresses as the electoral process goes on.

Literally just joined this sub because Pete has KILLED the debates tonight. Easily the best candidate in every aspect during this debate tonight.,"Great points. Great one-liners. Great rebuttals. That is all.

Edit: thank you for all of the welcomes! Such a nice community so far haha

Edit 2: this was my favorite moment of the debate: 
""Now, our party doesn't talk about that as much, largely for a good reason which was, we are committed to the separation of church and state and stand for people for any religion and people of no religion,"" said Buttigieg. ""But we should call out hypocrisy.""
""for a party that associates with Christianity to say it is OK to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages, has lost all claim to ever use religion language again.""

By far the best statement of the debate, thank you!

Biden, Bernie, Warren, Harris, and Pete (top 5) are going to be there for certain.

“Because I couldn’t get it done”,"Short background on me; I am a 21 y/o Southern man in college studying Criminal Justice. My parents and I are all by-the-book Democrats and full-fledged supporters of Mayor Pete. I intend to serve in the U.S. Army following graduation (or following a post-graduate degree depending on whether or not I get accepted haha). Additionally, my family and I are all Presbyterian Christians (my grandfather was a preacher for roughly 60 years) who are tired of the “Religious Right’s” bastardization of our faith into something self-serving, immoral, and contrary to all of the teachings of Jesus Christ. 

Tonight, I drove to my grandparents house to watch the debate with my family and some friends. As we were all discussing the candidates before the debate, a family friend asked me who I was supporting and why. I responded proudly by saying Mayor Pete Buttigieg because he is 1.) Incredibly intelligent and eloquent, 2.) because he is a proven civil servant, and 3.) because he is sincere in his love for this country and his fellow man. 

As the debate began, I found myself hoping that Mayor Pete would show up well and help improve his standing in the race,  and boy was I in for a happy night. Although I could make a full list of his highlights throughout the night, there is one that truly touched me. 

“Because I couldn’t get it done”

For those of you who didnt get a chance to watch the debates, this was Mayor Pete’s response to a question regarding tensions between police and POC in Southbend, and specifically about why the police force there has such a disproportionately low number of minority officers  (26% minority pop.  in Southbend vs. 6% minority officers in the police force). 
As someone who is studying CJ, this is an incredibly important issue for me. Minority representation in policing agencies is a major issue across the U.S., with POC and women generally being under-represented in the profession. This is definitely the case in Southbend, which (based off of the reports and news stories I have read) does have a long-lasting issue with police-minority relations. 

When he was asked this question, Mayor Pete didn’t try to deflect or make excuses. He didn’t get angry or defensive, and he didnt deny the existence of the problem. He responded by saying, “Because I couldn’t get it done”. 

There is an old saying that goes “A good leader takes the blame and shares the glory”, and that is exactly what Mayor Pete did tonight. At the cost of losing face, and contrary to what most candidates would do, Mayor Pete took the blame for a problem that he had a hand in creating. He didnt scapegoat anyone or shy away from the hard truth, he looked the nation in the face and took the blame. Even when Rep.  Swalwell took a cheap shot at Mayor Pete’s leadership, Mayor Pete responded respectfully and logically which is more than could be expected of him. 

Tonight reminded me why I support Mayor Pete. Tonight reminded me why Mayor Pete is the only candidate I’ve ever given money to, and why he is the only candidate that I have ever displayed my support for on my personal vehicle or Yeti cooler (long story short- stickers on Yetis are a BIG DEAL for college guys in the south). 

Even though Mayor Pete will likely never see this post, I want him to know that his honesty, courage, and integrity have not and will not go unnoticed, and that there are Americans from every walk of life - Urban Socialites, Rural Homebodies, and Liberal Rednecks (like myself) - who love and support him. Mayor Pete has re-kindled my passion for this country and for serving others and I am incredibly proud to support him for President. 

As a final note, in the Bible, one of God’s chosen and beloved leaders was King David. At the end of David’s life, despite his numerous personal failures and foibles, the Bible described him as “a man after his [God’s] own heart” (1 Samuel 13:14). This is considered to be the highest of praises that a man can receive, and although I am neither a pastor not a perfect Christian, I can say with certainty that Mayor Pete truly is a Man after God’s own heart.

It’s something that has to occupy so much of my time and thoughts, that someone hasn’t even thought about it is wild.

European outsider here,"Hi everyone ! 

&amp;#x200B;

Coming to you from the other side of the pond. I try to follow politics as much as I can in the countries that matter in the world, and let's face it, whomever you guys eventually pick next year, it's gonna have an impact on all of us; when you guys (not necessarily you personally, but the American people) chose Trump, he nearly dragged us in to WW3 just last week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now when it comes to this years' primaries, what strikes me about Buttigieg is that he seems to be a genuinely good person, which is a very nice change of pace. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, tell me, in your honest opinion, what are his changes of getting on the ticket? I know I'm posting this to a sub of his supporters so in all logic you will have some bias, but the reason I'm asking is I've been trying to comb through the polls but eventually came to the conclusion that it's still too early to say really anything. In 2016 Bernie dragged himself out of the race as well and that wasn't a given before the end of the primaries. Clinton of course was to be expected. It is my belief that anecdotal evidence can give you a feel of the situation. So, tell me dear Americans, what is your feel for Buttigieg's chances?",buttigieg,"European outsider here Hi everyone !

He speaks for us,"I’ve been a Pete gal since the day I heard my first Pete interview back in the exploratory committee days. My husband has been more on the Warren train and really hadn’t heard Pete speak much. Today during the debate though he  told me “He actually speaks for us.”

Having someone who is my generation with both intellect and heart is amazing. When he speaks it’s authentic and true. No matter how many boxes he may check in the ways he speaks to demographics (gay, veteran, son of immigrant, Ivy League education, etc etc) he never uses it in a way that doesn’t enhance the conversation. It’s so refreshing I could cry.

With 2020 approaching faster than ever, I just wanted to ask for ideas to further help his campaign. I go to school with a demographic really on board with Pete, and we want to help. Next year I plan to start a PeteForAmerica club at my school to disperse his campaign to more and more people and also raise funds to donate too.

Help on reconciling my support for Pete with my core values,"So ever since I heard someone from my state was running for the democratic nomination, I have been interested in Mayor Pete's campaign. I really like him and think he is by far the best democrat but I have one major issue that I've been really struggling with and that is my core belief in pro-life politics. I'm for universal healthcare, I want to ban the death penalty, and I support gun control, but I can't support abortion and I've been struggling to reconcile my support for Pete with my core values. Any advice on this? I'm crossing over from the GOP because I feel I can't vote for them in good conscience but I don't know if I can vote for anyone who advocates state funded abortion, I don't mean to come off like a radical Alabama type but being pro life in all aspects is incredibly important to me.

Edit:Just donated to Pete's campaign, while I'll continue to disagree with his support of publicly funded abortion, I realize publicly funded abortion is unlikely and I'm not going to find a better candidate than Pete for 2020. I really appreciate all of the feedback and the responses, and I thank all of you for being willing to have this conversation in a logical and as objective as possible manner. I was a little worried about posting this, and I'm glad you all were so willing to have this difficult conversation.",buttigieg,"Help on reconciling my support for Pete with my core values So ever since I heard someone from my state was running for the democratic nomination, I have been interested in Mayor Pete's campaign.

Stop worrying and try to channel that stoic yet compassionate energy that attracted us to Pete and to each other in the first place. Let’s go!! High fives all around!! 🙌🏼👍🏼👊🏼🤘🏼"

Pete @ DNC debate tonight : Help me deal with stress and anxiety,"Honestly, no public personality has captured my imagination as much as Pete ever in the last 10 years. I was pretty much indifferent to politics despite being a hard core democrat. But ever since March I dont know why but Pete changed my life. I begin my day with Pete’s news and check for any kind of update about him every 5 to 10 minutes. Whenever there is a big event going to be attended by Pete, that day I lose my focus and cannot concentrate on anything else.

MississipPete sighting in Jackson this morning!,,buttigieg,MississipPete sighting in Jackson this morning! 
Modeling Our Values as Supporters,"Over the past week, we've all been terribly frustrated with the national media portrayal of the events going on in South Bend. As supporters who have followed this campaign intimately, we have a right to be frustrated that this police shooting has overshadowed the many positive measures taken by Pete's administration to improve racial equity and justice in South Bend. And we have a right to be frustrated that Pete is taking the blame for structural racism at the national level that he has fought against, that existed long before he was mayor, and that can only be addressed by intentional policymaking at the federal level. I get that. I am also grateful that we have taken the effort to compile resources to set the record straight on his history. Those who are open to listening will see that. In good time.

But not everyone is interested in listening right now, because the narrative they've absorbed is directly aligned with their preexisting worldview and beliefs. Psychological studies have shown that when people's core beliefs are challenged, it ignites a fight or flight response that only pushes them further into their bubble. Most of the well-intentioned responses to critics I've seen so far have fallen into this category. For those people, this approach is counterproductive. People are attracted to those who make them feel good about themselves. If our actions as ambassadors of the campaign are making people feel defensive, we are undermining our own cause. I'm guilty of this too. More importantly, by responding with what Pete has done, rather than with what can be done that's constructive, we are attempting to turn back the clock. **We can never turn back the clock, and an honest politics must focus on the future.**

That means that no matter whether or not we believe someone is wrong, we have to respectfully invite them onto our side. We have to come at people from where they are, not from where we wish they'd be. Think about how Pete responded to [that conservative woman who referred to Chasten as his ""friend.""](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mayor-pete-buttigieg-policy-ideas.html) He could have corrected her, but instead, he allowed her to feel good about herself for having taken such a big step. The same applies here. **We will only win people over when we engage them through their values.**

**What people want, most of all, is to feel heard.** When we are spamming every single tweet criticizing race relations in South Bend with the same copy-pasted rebuttal, we make it sound as though we are shouting them down. It doesn't matter if they're wrong and we're right, because [""a hit dog will holler.""](https://time.com/5434734/andrew-gillum-a-hit-dog-will-holler/) It makes them assume that our defensiveness means we don't care, and that leads to division rather than unity. I don't want us to come across as dismissive or arrogant. And frankly, I really don't want the positive elements of Pete's history with race relations to become the ""but Bernie marched with MLK"" of our campaign.

How do we make people feel heard? The best way to do so is by taking a ""yes, and"" approach to our critics, rather than a ""no, actually"" approach. Find a grain of truth that you agree with in their worldview, and use that to start a conversation about productive measures. Foster empathy by allowing the other side to imagine themselves as the mayor, or even better, to imagine Pete in the Oval Office. Allow them to make suggestions about what the city should do, while acknowledging the constraints of state law. If they suggest something productive, agree with them and say that you hope the city will do that. Ask them if they think the national spotlight on South Bend can finally build momentum around comprehensive national urban policing policy. And most of all, **demonstrate that we are here not to blindly support our candidate, but to do what's best on this issue both for the city and the country.**

Incidentally, this is about being a good ally as well. Good allies listen to the concerns of downtrodden groups and elevates those concerns. They do not dismiss them. And because this shooting has come to symbolize racism in policing, responding by denying these concerns makes us seem like bad allies and shitty people to join hands with. We must not hurt ourselves by lashing out in frustration. Instead, we must use this as an opportunity to listen to those who feel threatened and invite them to help us develop solutions. If we do that successfully, **we can change the channel** from the horror show we saw live on CNN.

Some examples of potential productive responses that could lead to engagement:

""I agree that racist and killer cops can't be allowed to remain on the streets. What's the best way for the city to do so, given that Indiana state law does not allow Mayors to directly fire officers?"" (this could be a good segue into how to challenge police unions, especially given [the letter the South Bend FOP wrote yesterday](https://www.abc57.com/news/South-Bend-Fraternal-Order-of-Police-releases-statement-about-the-deadly-officer-involved-shooting))

""South Bend clearly has a problem of racism on its police force that is also a problem of regional and national scope. How do we combat the cultural factors that stop our police departments from looking like our communities?"" (a good opportunity to discuss productive ways to improve and sustain minority recruitment)

""With the national spotlight on South Bend, this seems like an opportunity to finally build momentum around a comprehensive national policy on urban policing. Do you agree?"" (a way to discuss the inescapable connection between national and local issues that Pete often talks about)

tl;dr: **Use this as an opportunity to model our values**, rather than shout down our opponents. Connect our values to those of our potential supporters. Don't say, but show that we are committed to solving our country's problem through this campaign, rather than just boosting our candidate. This doesn't just apply to this single issue! We will come out far better for it, and so will those we support.

Message I got from a Debate Night Watch Party organizer...,"So I originally signed up for a debate watch party through the Pete for America page. On Monday I got a message from the organizer introducing himself and asking for more information about myself since I was the only “stranger” that signed up for his event. He included this in his message...

“Events of the last 48 hours led me to decide our get together simply a political debate among four undesirable candidates. 

Peter's behaviors toward his constituents regarding the shooting of a black man by a white cop pretty much qualifies him to run as a Republican. I wouldn't be surprised if the cop killed the guy just to hurt Pete's presidential chances.

So support any of your other favorites Somewhere in the field of 22 candidates there must be someone who can beat Trump.”

I replied saying I wasn’t going to be able to make it (work travel came up) and asking for his feedback on what he thinks Pete could’ve done differently. But even if I was able to I don’t think I’d join after that. My interest was to be among like minded folks that supported or were thinking of supporting Pete, and I understand if someone is upset at how Pete has handled the  events of the last few days, but to call him a Republican/undesirable is just a jump too big for me...

"I volunteered for Bernie in the past, so I get texts from people about helping phone bank etc. I told them I now support Mayor Pete. The guy asked me why, so I sent him my ABCs to Pete.

“Pete Cheat Sheet” aka “ABCs of Pete”
***
* A- Afghan War Vet. Counter intelligence officer who was deployed overseas. One of very few Democratic elected officials who served in active duty military.
* B- Bipartisanship. As a mayor you have to work with local legislators from across the ideological spectrum. And Pete had to do that to move proposals forward like 1000 homes in 1000 days and smart sewers.
* C- Church. Pete is a church going Christian. Believes republicans have acted like they own religion and that the religious left has lacked fair representation. Accepting and encouraging of all religious people and people who aren’t religious at all. 
* D- Democracy. Eliminate electoral college. The man or woman who gets the most votes should win. Make sure voters choice their elected officials instead of elected officials choosing their voters through gerrymandering. Automatic voter registration. Increased access to polls and early voting. Election Day national holiday. 
* E- Education. Appointing a security of Public education that actually cares about public education. Better pay for teachers. Better resources for underfunded schools. Make community colleges free and public universities free for low income students. Married to Chasten Glezman, a middle school public school teacher.
* F- Freedom. Freedom to pursue the American dream, start a business, get a good education without loads of debt. Freedom to change jobs without losing your health insurance. Freedom to love who you choose and marry the one you love. Freedom from hate and appeals to bigotry from our elected leaders.
* G- Global warming. Accepts climate science as a scientific fact and a national security crisis. We need to increase renewables. Create new green jobs. Increase tax incentives for energy efficiency. Is receptive to Green New Deal and appears to support its most vital components. Has said multiple times climate change is America’s #1 national security threat.
* H- Higher Education: making college tuition free for low income people, not for people in the top 10%. Nobody that I would ever support would be okay with sons of millionaires going to college tuition free. Also, complete loan forgiveness is not a feasible option based on independent non partisan assessments. Pete sees that and recognizes that there are better options, like providing tuition free college for people who spend at least a year in national service.
* I- Indiana: After recent shootings in Indiana Mayor Pete stepped off the campaign trail to support his community. He walked into the fire knowing it wasn’t politically smart. He’s catching tremendous heat over it, but he did it anyways, because he truly cares for his city and the people he represents.
* I#2- Independents: Pete has the lowest name ID of the top tier candidates and the some of the widest support among independents. The same independents that got trump elected. He’s got more room for growth than most if not all viable candidates, and he can and will win independents.
* J- Judicial Branch: making crucial reforms to the Supreme Court to depoliticize the process of determining who will dole out the precedents upon which our society rests.
* K-Kind. A lot of Pete supporters have met the man. He is in person who he is in the media. Kind, calm, gentle and patient.
* L- Legalize marijuana. Treat substance abuse like the mental health crisis it is instead of throwing people into for profit prisons, which should be done away with. Non violent drug offenders charged with simple possession don’t belong in jails and prisons. Disproportionately affects minorities.
* M- Medicare for all who want it. Put a version of Medicare on the exchange to use as a glide path away from our current system. Wants Medicare for all soon but need to transition. Everyone needs healthcare regardless of their ability to pay. Medicare for all is divisive. Adding the “all who want it clause” makes it an easier pill to swallow for people stuck on the foolish notion that socialized medicine would hurt our country. 
* N- New. New generation of leadership. He would be the youngest president to take the oath of office. He’s going to be effected by the policies he works to implement. I think that will drive him harder than someone who may not survive to see the effects of some of the Democratic Party’s proposals regarding climate change, for instance. 
* O- Opposition: Good luck finding dirt on this guy. The best people have got against him is that some people think he could’ve done more to make the police force blacker?? That he should’ve personally had control over when body cameras turn on?? That he fired a black police chief that was performing federally illegal wiretaps?? The average voter can tell that he is doing as good as one person can do, and that he has learned and continues to learn from his mistakes as a good leader does.
* P- Pro choice. Believes that women’s health care decisions are best left to women and their docs and the last thing they need when facing these hard decisions are male politicians legislating their bodily autonomy.
* Q- Quiet. When he’s asked a question, he doesn’t start mentally prepping his formulated response. He stays quiet and listens to everyone and responds calmly and with unparalleled composure. This couldn’t be any clearer than it is now after having watched his South Bend town hall following the killing of a black man by a white police officer.
* R- Racism and reparations. Condemn it in all forms. Advance policies that encourage black entrepreneurship and black community re-investment and growth. Wage and wealth inequalities must be addressed and remedied actively. Not through words alone.
* S- Security- a robust and prepared military that doesn’t have to outspend the next 10 nations combined. Calling our adversaries out when they threaten the peace (russia annexing Crimea). Reclaiming our place in the world as a moral leader who doesn’t lock children up in cages. Commitment to denuclearization globally. Border security that doesn’t dehumanize those seeking asylum from murderous regimes. Strong and steadfast defense.
* T- Trump. He has more government experience than Trump. More executive experience than Pence. And the most military experience of any president entering the Oval Office since George HW Bush. Call out his lies. But don’t engage his name calling. He flails, we laugh.
* U- Unification. He participated in a Fox town hall not simply to tear down the network but to present his message to people who may never hear Democrat’s perspectives be abuse we don’t talk to them. Pete is bringing everyone to the table.
* V- Veracity: he tells the truth even when it hurts. He doesn’t change who he is based on what crowd he presents in front of. He sticks to his convictions and to the facts. 
* W- Wisdom: Somehow this 37 year old mayor of a small town comes off more thoughtful than all the other candidates (maybe with the exception of Warren). He has clearly staked principled positions on all the issues that will win the election and the generation for the Democratic Party.
* X- X-Factor. He has charisma. Some preternatural ability to calm the nerves and anxieties of a wildly sensitive nation that’s at a critical crossroads. Without someone that can charm even the people who don’t like his/her message, we don’t stand a chance. 
* Y- Youth. He campaigns for generational change. We need a new generation of leaders I elected office, bc we will ultimately be dealing with the crises we inherit long after the older generations have passed. 
* Z- Zero tolerance for cheap political jabs and point scoring. When he hits, it seems to be because it needs to be said not to score political points. People liked to say he was taking shots at Pence for publicity, but he’s been calling him out since Day 1.",buttigieg,"I volunteered for Bernie in the past, so I get texts from people about helping phone bank etc. I told them I now support Mayor Pete.

* X- X-Factor. He has charisma. Some preternatural ability to calm the nerves and anxieties of a wildly sensitive nation that’s at a critical crossroads. Without someone that can charm even the people who don’t like his/her message, we don’t stand a chance. 
* Y- Youth. He campaigns for generational change. We need a new generation of leaders I elected office, bc we will ultimately be dealing with the crises we inherit long after the older generations have passed. 
* Z- Zero tolerance for cheap political jabs and point scoring. When he hits, it seems to be because it needs to be said not to score political points. People liked to say he was taking shots at Pence for publicity, but he’s been calling him out since Day 1."

His Supreme Court plan?,"I’m not hugely knowledgeable about our system in DC, but I know that democratic reform should be a top priority- part of the reason I like Pete. If nothing else, he will bring this issue to the forefront if elected. However, I’m a bit confused about his 5-5-5 Supreme Court plan he’s mentioned in past interviews. The biggest concern would be codification of the two-party system. I’d really like to leave all three branches of government open to future political parties as America evolves and changes. However, the acknowledgment of these two parties seems like it could lock what we have now into place. I’m very much open to depoliticizing the Supreme Court, but would this reform help? Also, how do we define who’s “democrat” and who’s a “republican” judge without further intervention of the political parties themselves? Is it just the party of the president that nominated them like it is now? It seems like this would involve politics with the Court even more heavily than before(besides the 5 supposedly apolitical judges). Please correct me if this is not the case, and explain why.

The Opportunity that lies in Last Week's South Bend fallout,"In every crises lies an opportunity. I know it seems like the negative press is out of control in this period. But as many black leaders from Jackson, Sharpton and others have pointed out: There's an opportunity here. The opportunity is simply to be seen as someone who can be the leader on racial issues. It makes perfect sense too. Looking at all the candidates, no one is a leader on black issues in America. Corey Booker and Kamala Harris have addressed aspects of racial inequity, Warren and Bernie give policies that cater to the masses, or diagnose the issue as a lack of funding or access to funding and throw money at the problem, Biden is riding on the coattails of Obama. But no one is actually leading.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter Pete Buttigieg. First, he has been spurred on by resistance or just ignorance of his candidacy in the black community to address racial inequity head on with his Douglass Plan. But with this recent crises in South Bend Pete has an even greater opportunity to mark even more ground by creating a comprehensive nationwide policy on urban policing. Pete can do this and pitch this as his response to the complaints he received on the ground. I have gradually come to realize that the activists actually were acting very rationally. They simply attempted to make the most noise to draw in the Media to their issue, literally to take advantage of the fact that Buttigieg now had a national presence. If they simply kept quiet, applauded and went about their day, they wouldn't get much attention from the press. However, the strategy fails if they derail Pete's candidacy, and you've seen activists try to pivot to, ""this is a first step"". In a sense they have used the crises and its victims (Eric Logan's family) to bring attention to an issue that has a long history. They are also using this issue as a means to put leverage over Mayor Pete. If he wants to have a good candidacy, he will listen to their concerns. If he ignores this issue, they've already gotten access to national media and so they can always give interviews that could show he is ignoring their concerns which could derail any momentum he has in growing his POC vote.

But I see it more as an opportunity, not a hostage situation. Both could work symbiotically. The activists and black community could be a part of a conversation in a larger dialogue to prevent any more Eric Logan's in the nation. Pete could use this issue to highlight Black poverty, policing in urban areas, and keep hammering his douglass plan. It would be political gold to have the activists working side by side with Mayor Pete to address key issues in Urban policing. This would first nullify the critics that say he did nothing for Southbend because he has black activists ready to defend his record. It would also be a case of not just genuine good will but good politics to lead on the issue. The story would be one on Leadership, turning disaster and bad will into solutions and good will. If he can co opt a few activists, not all, then he would win the battle. But beyond coopting the activists, he needs to be the standout leader on Black policy. It should be associated with Mayor Pete. His Freedom platform should be heavily focused on reducing racial inequity, not just the ability to sue credit card companies.

&amp;#x200B;

It could be a win win situation.

"Thoughts on the crisis in South Bend, and our response to it.","TLDR: A lot of people ""attacking"" Pete aren't enemies. They don't exist to make Pete's life miserable. They're Black residents of South Bend with a legitimate fear of police violence, and not people that we have to ""defend"" Pete against. 

I'm a huge Pete Buttigieg supporter. I'm hosting a watch party for the debate Thursday and have ordered my ""Pete"" cookie cutter to make snacks. I have google alerts for ""Pete Buttigieg"" turned on so I can keep up with the campaign. I believe that Pete is a compassionate, incredible person who should be our next president.

I don't think, though, that he should be devoid of criticism for what's happening in South Bend. Pete has revitalized South Bend, but a large percentage of Black constituents remain in poverty. Whether you think it's justifiable or not, he fired the first Black police chief in the history of South Bend. His efforts to introduce body cameras and diversify the South Bend police department were unsuccessful. That doesn't mean that he's a bad person, or that he didn't try - far from it - but it is still unjust and horrific that the murder of Eric Logan wasn't prevented, that it happened.

Here's where I think that sometimes this subreddit goes wrong, and here's where I think Mayor Pete would agree with me. I feel like, and I'm guilty of this too, a lot of people have taken an antagonistic position against the people criticizing Pete. We get defensive and try to argue with them, because we believe in Pete, hate seeing him insulted or shouted at, and feel for him because he's facing some really hard challenges. I see a lot of posts about how the anger against him is misguided, polls about how he might lose the ""black vote,"" and articles on how to dispel misconceptions about the mistakes he's made while handling this crisis. Basically, I see a lot of posts ""in defense"" of him.

But, just like Pete is a human being, I feel like we need to remember that people who are angry are as well. I'm not Black, but I've done a lot of research over the past few days on policy brutality to try to understand better. What I've read is that for a lot of Black people, they can't go outside without being afraid; they can't send their kids to school without worrying that they won't come back. Even the literal deaths of Black people at the hands of the police isn't enough to convince much of the political system, including the democratic party, to do anything meaningful that will prevent the murder of Black people. We shouldn't be antagonistic, or defensive - **like who are we defending Pete against?** The people shouting at Pete aren't enemies. They're not some sort of anti-Pete coalition that exist solely to make his life miserable and generate negative press. They're people, part of Pete's community, with intense and legitimate fears.

Pete knows that, in my opinion, and he cares about it, because he cares about his community and the people living in it. That's why he held that town hall. That's why he was so emotional with the press afterwards. That's why he canceled so many campaign activities to go be in South Bend. His community is hurting, he is too, and he wants to do whatever he can to fix it, not to see the Black community in South Bend continue to suffer. I'm not Black, nor do I live in South Bend, so I don't think I can say how well he's responded to this crisis. I do hope that he's holding up okay; that he learns from this and uses it to create better policy surrounding issues that affect Black voters so acutely, like this one. I hope he knows that a lot of people believe in him, and that they are right in doing so. And I hope everyone in South Bend, especially Black residents, are doing better too.

Does Mayor Pete defer too much to the Police Department?,"I listened to this Slate interview with Adam Wren of Indianapolis and Politico with a heavy heart. I'm rooting for Pete to do well in his campaign. But from the report here, if he doesn't take action that is different than what he has done in the past, this racist police problem will surely come back to haunt him and dent his poll numbers (already starting to). 

From the interview, it seems Mayor Pete does take a pretty detached, light-handed approach and defer too much to the Police Chief. Bringing people together and listening to the grievances alone won't work unless real steps are taken to ensure accountability. It seems the anger and frustration have been aired before (not with national spotlight) but allegedly racist police officers (O'Neil and Knepper) with history of inappropriate use of force against POC still patrol the street. So something needs to change for the crisis to not escalate. Why are the obviously racist cops still not disciplined? Why are cameras off? These are questions that I really hope Mayor Pete can address in a more proactive manner. 

I myself do not trust the police chief to deliver much at this point. I know Pete does care a lot and is hurting along with the black community. He also showed a lot of courage to face up to the problem and anger at the town hall. But I do hope he will pull some real mayoral weight to bring about real accountability in the police department.  

Otherwise, this could be a ticking time bomb that could damage his campaign and I really don't want that.",buttigieg,"Does Mayor Pete defer too much to the Police Department?

I wanted to put together a comprehensive list of Pete Buttigieg's work as Mayor to promote racial justice and equity. Please note that many of these items were achieved by or in conjunction with the team members, community leaders and citizens he has empowered to help build a more equitable society. It truly is a team effort. Please also note that, while these efforts have clearly been extensive, these are complex problems and often require solutions far beyond the reach of city government. South Bend has made some huge strides, yet, like every city, it clearly has a long way to go. **But the main thing I think this list shows is how deeply its Mayor, government, and community cares about finding solutions.**

* When local leaders asked for $3.5 million to renovate the Charles Black community center, which serves the historically black LaSalle Park neighborhood, Buttigieg managed to push through $4.5 million. [^[3]](https://www.abc57.com/news/charles-black-community-center-unveiled-thursday-community-relfects-on-legacy-and-future) Buttigieg was praised in a statement by the center’s director, Cynthia Taylor: “You’re gonna have to invite him in, you’re gonna have to sit him down, you’re gonna have to show him the issue,” she says. “Because he definitely will listen.” [^[4]](https://time.com/longform/pete-buttigieg-2020/)

* As part of the Center’s expansion, its computer lab will host the new Center for Learning, Information, Connectivity, and Knowledge (CLICK). This CLICK Center is part of an effort by the City of South Bend aimed at growing digital inclusion and helping community members gain the technology and digital literacy skills necessary to thrive in 2018 and beyond. [^[4]](https://medium.com/metronet-zing/charles-black-recreation-center-re-opens-after-4-4-million-renovation-589b617d9292)

* Started South Bend Youth Task Force to foster youth involvement in government and community. [^[5]](https://www.abc57.com/news/south-bend-mayor-starts-youth-task-force)

* South Bend named a ""High-Performing 'Race-Informed' City"" in the 2018 Equipt to Innovate national survey of American cities. The designation covers cities that foster supportive environments for collective community-wide racial healing and systemic structural equity. [^[6]](https://southbendin.gov/2018/04/26/south-bend-named-high-performing-race-informed-city/)

* The survey, a joint initiative by Living Cities and Governing magazine, offered high praise of South Bend's efforts to target structural racism: “Rooted in an understanding that government at all levels has played a role in creating and maintaining racial inequity, resulting in a lack of access and opportunity for people of color in everything from education and employment to housing and healthcare, these cities seek to redress structural racism through an analysis of their own operations and make necessary changes in policy and practice.” [^[6]](https://southbendin.gov/2018/04/26/south-bend-named-high-performing-race-informed-city/)

* Instituted My Brother's Keeper alliance, bridging city and local organizations together to address opportunity gaps for boys and young men of color. [^[7]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/south-bend-sees-success-in-young-men-boys-of-color-through-my-brothers-keeper-alliance)

* Renamed one of the most prominent streets in downtown South Bend after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, overcoming 40 years of resistance by white business owners and death threats to minority members of the naming committee. [^[8]](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/mayor-names-new-mlk-jr-boulevard-in-south-bend/article_ad348db4-69f1-5ba8-b45e-29f7be02af0f.html)

* Instructed campaign team to use his re-election campaign TV spots to help local Black leader Kareemah Fowler win her bid as a first-time candidate for City Clerk. [^[9]](https://twitter.com/KareemahFowler/status/1117536200078897153)

* Participates in and allocates resources for events that matter to minority communities in South Bend, both fun celebrations year-round and important protests like those for Eric Logan, the hoodie march for Trayvon Martin [^[10]](https://twitter.com/GoodGuyPete2020/status/1126962975867318273), and the [2017 Women’s March](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D9r8N7QVUAA2Pcd.jpg:large).

### Safety and Policing

* Launched the South Bend Group Violence Intervention (SBGVI) which “unites community leaders around a common goal: to stop gun violence and keep South Bend’s highest risk citizens alive and out of prison.” [^[11]](https://southbendin.gov/initiative/south-bend-group-violence-intervention/). The program aims to reduce violence by providing member of street groups avenues to succeed. Buttigieg fought to ensure continued funding and expansion of the program in the city’s 2019 budget. [^[12]](https://www.abc57.com/news/buttigieg-calls-group-violence-intervention)

* Instituted Implicit Bias Training for South Bend’s police force. [^[13]](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/22/pete-buttigieg-police-shooting-227206)

* Instituted Civil Rights Training for South Bend’s police force. [^[14]](https://www.ebony.com/news/race-culture/mayor-pete-buttigieg-plans-communities-color/)

* Invested $1.5 million to equip South Bend police officers with body cameras and upgrade vehicle dash cameras, in order to ensure safety and accountability for both residents and officers. [^[15]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/second-phase-of-south-bend-police-body-camera-installations-happening-today)

* Consistent focus on diversity recruitment initiatives, including recruitment incentive bonuses for officers [^[16]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/city-leaders-lack-of-diversity-plaguing-south-bend-police-department), making applications available online, and publicly releasing data on their diversity recruiting efforts on the front page of the SBPD website. When the data noted that minority applicants often dropped out before the physical test, the SBPD began to offer a practice physical test prior to the official test [^[17]](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/opinion/our_opinion/our-opinion-recruiting-minority-police-officers-must-remain-a-priority/article_4e0dcf06-2898-5d95-bf67-b2c6585df4d5.html)

* Pushed for police transparency that allowed residents to see what was happening and hold the department accountable. Instituted South Bend Police’s “Open Data Hub”, an online transparency database, so any resident can easily get data on crime statistics, case reports (including the number of times police had to use force when answering a call), and shows both officer complaints and compliments. The transparency hub was noted for being very advanced for a city of South Bend’s size. [^[18]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/south-bend-police-launch-data-hub)

* While all police hiring and firing must be made by the civilian Board of Public Safety under Indiana law, Buttigieg has appointed an African-American majority (3 out of 4 positions) in order to ensure public trust and accountability. [^[19]](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/22/pete-buttigieg-police-shooting-227206)

* Instituted ShotSpotter technology, a series of acoustic sensors throughout the city that allows police to pinpoint and react to gunshots almost immediately. [^[20]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/shotspotter-south-bend-police-says-technology-aiding-in-investigations)

* South Bend Common Council unanimously passed Gun Violence Prevention Resolution, which calls on federal and state lawmakers to require background checks for all gun sales and close loopholes that give certain domestic abusers easy access to guns. The vote was praised by Moms Demand Action and Everytown Survivor Network. [^[21]](https://everytown.org/press/gun-violence-survivor-indiana-moms-demand-action-applaud-south-bend-common-council-for-unanimously-passing-gun-violence-prevention-resolution/)

* Worked with Police Department to ensure extensive focus on community policing, citing in his 2018 state of the city address that officers conducted “7,000 foot patrols, attended 168 neighborhood meetings, and conducted ‘Coffee with a Cop’ outreach opportunities around our community.” As a result of this and other initiatives, he said, “the number of incidents leading to a use of force has gone down by a third in the last four years, and the number of investigations and complaints against police officers has fallen dramatically.” [^[22]](https://southbendin.gov/2018/03/14/mayors-state-of-city-address/)

### Housing

* Residents in low-income communities routinely identified vacant and abandoned houses, caused by South Bend’s population decline from 130k to 100k, as a leading health, safety, and economic problem in their neighborhoods. Buttigieg instituted the ‘1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days’ program to repair or demolish vacant and abandoned houses. [^[23]](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-inpractice-011116.html)

* The program recently entered a new phase in which the city is providing free legal and financial assistance to the low-income community members who live next to the torn down homes so that they can purchase the lots and build up their own communities. [^[24]](https://southbendin.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Resident-Legal-Assistance-Program-Guidelines.pdf)

* Statistics have shown that criminal activity has decreased within a half mile of vacant and abandoned homes addressed by the city. [^[25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uH8_8_nq1Y)

* The program was not without hiccups. It was sometimes hard to locate owners of the abandoned houses, and early on some well-meaning residents found abandoned houses they were hoping to renovate slated for demolition. However, Buttigieg was praised for quickly addressing the issue. When property owned by local resident Stacey Odom ended up on the demolition list, she explained the problem during a chance encounter with the mayor on the street. He later held a series of meetings with her and others to talk about the plan, and she credits the mayor for getting her home—and 40% of other residents' homes—removed from the list. Odom later said: ""When I saw that he was willing to help, that's what turned me. That's what said to me, this is a man that has the potential to be president."" [^[25.5]](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-record/index.html)

* Created a $650K Home Repair Pilot Program, a grant program to help low-income residents repair &amp; keep homes. [^[26]](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/Home-Repair-Pilot-Program-to-fund-about-65-home-improvements-489303081.html)

### Economic Prosperity

* Started Office of Engagement &amp; Economic Empowerment to help address the wealth gap [^[27]](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/South-Bend-to-keep-fighting-for-the-best-future-for-the-next-generation-476762913.html)

* Commissioned the Racial Wealth Divide Initiative, a comprehensive report on South Bend’s wealth inequality, through Washington D.C.-based advocacy group Prosperity NOW. [^[28]](https://www.abc57.com/news/sb-community-group-to-host-meeting-about-racial-wealth-divide) Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, the researcher who compiled the [Prosperity Now] report, said Buttigieg was the first mayor of any city to ask him to do this. [^[29]](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/South-Bend-to-keep-fighting-for-the-best-future-for-the-next-generation-476762913.html)

* Based on the results of the Racial Wealth Divide Initiative, held seminars across the community that gave neighborhood leaders the tools to identify the existing talents and skills of residents and connect them into business opportunities. [^[30]](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/business/south-bend-project-hopes-to-grow-small-businesses-and-target/article_d5a602e4-cb3d-11e7-85b7-9b186272284d.html)

* Funded the West Side Small Business Resource Center, the first in a series of community centers aimed at lifting minority entrepreneurs and generating new wealth in underserved areas. [^[31]](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/business/new-business-center-in-south-bend-aims-to-lift-minority/article_a66a2669-754b-5e89-a4c2-42ed33dafb7d.html) According to James Summers, chairman of the project: “This initiative is a truly grassroots and community-focused approach to generating new wealth through small business. The center provides unprecedented access to resources and networking, and as local businesses grow and employ neighbors, the entire community is strengthened”

* Empowered Office of Diversity and Inclusion to ensure government contracts and purchasing targets minority- and women-owned businesses vendors within the city’s marketplace, and commissioned a study of current practices to ensure progress and accountability. [^[32]](https://southbendin.gov/2018/03/14/mayors-state-of-city-address/)

* Applied for and received a $50k Inclusive Procurement Grant. The grant was awarded based on South Bend’s vision to pursue a range of projects to find innovative, effective, locally-tailored strategies to leverage public purchasing power to develop firms owned by people of color. Local initiatives range from implementing aggressive outreach strategies, developing procurement portals and creating an ecosystem of support services for firms owned by people of color to increase their opportunities to gain city contracts. [^[33]](https://www.sbrchamber.com/news/2019/06/21/default/south-bend-receives-50k-inclusive-procurement-grant/)

* Raised the minimum wage for city employees. His plan called for a raise from $7.25 to $10.10 by 2018, but he was able to accelerate the schedule to accomplish it by 2016. [^[34]](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/Buttigieg-proposes-accelerated-minimum-wage-increase-for-city-employees-396574751.html)

* Participates in and allocates resources for events that matter to minority communities in South Bend, both fun celebrations year-round and important protests like those for Eric Logan, the hoodie march for Trayvon Martin [^[10]](https://twitter.com/GoodGuyPete2020/status/1126962975867318273), and the [2017 Women’s March](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D9r8N7QVUAA2Pcd.jpg:large).

### Safety and Policing

* Launched the South Bend Group Violence Intervention (SBGVI) which “unites community leaders around a common goal: to stop gun violence and keep South Bend’s highest risk citizens alive and out of prison.” [^[11]](https://southbendin.gov/initiative/south-bend-group-violence-intervention/). The program aims to reduce violence by providing member of street groups avenues to succeed. Buttigieg fought to ensure continued funding and expansion of the program in the city’s 2019 budget. [^[12]](https://www.abc57.com/news/buttigieg-calls-group-violence-intervention)

* Instituted Implicit Bias Training for South Bend’s police force. [^[13]](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/22/pete-buttigieg-police-shooting-227206)

* Instituted Civil Rights Training for South Bend’s police force. [^[14]](https://www.ebony.com/news/race-culture/mayor-pete-buttigieg-plans-communities-color/)

* Invested $1.5 million to equip South Bend police officers with body cameras and upgrade vehicle dash cameras, in order to ensure safety and accountability for both residents and officers. [^[15]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/second-phase-of-south-bend-police-body-camera-installations-happening-today)

* Consistent focus on diversity recruitment initiatives, including recruitment incentive bonuses for officers [^[16]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/city-leaders-lack-of-diversity-plaguing-south-bend-police-department), making applications available online, and publicly releasing data on their diversity recruiting efforts on the front page of the SBPD website. When the data noted that minority applicants often dropped out before the physical test, the SBPD began to offer a practice physical test prior to the official test [^[17]](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/opinion/our_opinion/our-opinion-recruiting-minority-police-officers-must-remain-a-priority/article_4e0dcf06-2898-5d95-bf67-b2c6585df4d5.html)

* Pushed for police transparency that allowed residents to see what was happening and hold the department accountable. Instituted South Bend Police’s “Open Data Hub”, an online transparency database, so any resident can easily get data on crime statistics, case reports (including the number of times police had to use force when answering a call), and shows both officer complaints and compliments. The transparency hub was noted for being very advanced for a city of South Bend’s size. [^[18]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/south-bend-police-launch-data-hub)

* While all police hiring and firing must be made by the civilian Board of Public Safety under Indiana law, Buttigieg has appointed an African-American majority (3 out of 4 positions) in order to ensure public trust and accountability. [^[19]](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/22/pete-buttigieg-police-shooting-227206)

* Instituted ShotSpotter technology, a series of acoustic sensors throughout the city that allows police to pinpoint and react to gunshots almost immediately. [^[20]](https://wsbt.com/news/local/shotspotter-south-bend-police-says-technology-aiding-in-investigations)

* South Bend Common Council unanimously passed Gun Violence Prevention Resolution, which calls on federal and state lawmakers to require background checks for all gun sales and close loopholes that give certain domestic abusers easy access to guns. The vote was praised by Moms Demand Action and Everytown Survivor Network. [^[21]](https://everytown.org/press/gun-violence-survivor-indiana-moms-demand-action-applaud-south-bend-common-council-for-unanimously-passing-gun-violence-prevention-resolution/)

* Worked with Police Department to ensure extensive focus on community policing, citing in his 2018 state of the city address that officers conducted “7,000 foot patrols, attended 168 neighborhood meetings, and conducted ‘Coffee with a Cop’ outreach opportunities around our community.” As a result of this and other initiatives, he said, “the number of incidents leading to a use of force has gone down by a third in the last four years, and the number of investigations and complaints against police officers has fallen dramatically.” [^[22]](https://southbendin.gov/2018/03/14/mayors-state-of-city-address/)

### Housing

* Residents in low-income communities routinely identified vacant and abandoned houses, caused by South Bend’s population decline from 130k to 100k, as a leading health, safety, and economic problem in their neighborhoods. Buttigieg instituted the ‘1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days’ program to repair or demolish vacant and abandoned houses. [^[23]](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-inpractice-011116.html)

* The program recently entered a new phase in which the city is providing free legal and financial assistance to the low-income community members who live next to the torn down homes so that they can purchase the lots and build up their own communities. [^[24]](https://southbendin.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Resident-Legal-Assistance-Program-Guidelines.pdf)

* Statistics have shown that criminal activity has decreased within a half mile of vacant and abandoned homes addressed by the city. [^[25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uH8_8_nq1Y)

* The program was not without hiccups. It was sometimes hard to locate owners of the abandoned houses, and early on some well-meaning residents found abandoned houses they were hoping to renovate slated for demolition. However, Buttigieg was praised for quickly addressing the issue. When property owned by local resident Stacey Odom ended up on the demolition list, she explained the problem during a chance encounter with the mayor on the street. He later held a series of meetings with her and others to talk about the plan, and she credits the mayor for getting her home—and 40% of other residents' homes—removed from the list. Odom later said: ""When I saw that he was willing to help, that's what turned me. That's what said to me, this is a man that has the potential to be president."" [^[25.5]](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-record/index.html)

* Created a $650K Home Repair Pilot Program, a grant program to help low-income residents repair &amp; keep homes. [^[26]](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/Home-Repair-Pilot-Program-to-fund-about-65-home-improvements-489303081.html)

### Economic Prosperity

* Started Office of Engagement &amp; Economic Empowerment to help address the wealth gap [^[27]](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/South-Bend-to-keep-fighting-for-the-best-future-for-the-next-generation-476762913.html)

* Commissioned the Racial Wealth Divide Initiative, a comprehensive report on South Bend’s wealth inequality, through Washington D.C.-based advocacy group Prosperity NOW. [^[28]](https://www.abc57.com/news/sb-community-group-to-host-meeting-about-racial-wealth-divide) Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, the researcher who compiled the [Prosperity Now] report, said Buttigieg was the first mayor of any city to ask him to do this. [^[29]](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/South-Bend-to-keep-fighting-for-the-best-future-for-the-next-generation-476762913.html)

* Based on the results of the Racial Wealth Divide Initiative, held seminars across the community that gave neighborhood leaders the tools to identify the existing talents and skills of residents and connect them into business opportunities. [^[30]](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/business/south-bend-project-hopes-to-grow-small-businesses-and-target/article_d5a602e4-cb3d-11e7-85b7-9b186272284d.html)

* Funded the West Side Small Business Resource Center, the first in a series of community centers aimed at lifting minority entrepreneurs and generating new wealth in underserved areas. [^[31]](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/business/new-business-center-in-south-bend-aims-to-lift-minority/article_a66a2669-754b-5e89-a4c2-42ed33dafb7d.html) According to James Summers, chairman of the project: “This initiative is a truly grassroots and community-focused approach to generating new wealth through small business. The center provides unprecedented access to resources and networking, and as local businesses grow and employ neighbors, the entire community is strengthened”

* Empowered Office of Diversity and Inclusion to ensure government contracts and purchasing targets minority- and women-owned businesses vendors within the city’s marketplace, and commissioned a study of current practices to ensure progress and accountability. [^[32]](https://southbendin.gov/2018/03/14/mayors-state-of-city-address/)

* Applied for and received a $50k Inclusive Procurement Grant. The grant was awarded based on South Bend’s vision to pursue a range of projects to find innovative, effective, locally-tailored strategies to leverage public purchasing power to develop firms owned by people of color. Local initiatives range from implementing aggressive outreach strategies, developing procurement portals and creating an ecosystem of support services for firms owned by people of color to increase their opportunities to gain city contracts. [^[33]](https://www.sbrchamber.com/news/2019/06/21/default/south-bend-receives-50k-inclusive-procurement-grant/)

* Raised the minimum wage for city employees. His plan called for a raise from $7.25 to $10.10 by 2018, but he was able to accelerate the schedule to accomplish it by 2016. [^[34]](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/Buttigieg-proposes-accelerated-minimum-wage-increase-for-city-employees-396574751.html)

Debate strategy,"Pete should follow the comments that @realdonaldtrump makes and attack him live on the air. He might say “Its really hard not to look at a train wreck. So speaking of which, Trump just tweeted the stupidest thing about this” *(holds up phone and quotes the tweet) Then gives short brilliant rebuttal/solution.

This trick would attack a live quote made by Trump when one was not provided to the other candidates. It will cause reporters to want a response from Trump and thus, a viral debate clip.

EDIT: So I posted this after a few glasses of gin. I agree seeing this myself in a candidate (especially one I really like) would probably make me throw up in the mouth a little bit. I’m simply thinking about how crap like this is what makes news. Beto is getting top billing for the debates last night; why? He spoke Spanish. . Gimmicks and stunts like this are easy to criticize. I agree it’s not presidential, or mature, but maybe there’s no such thing as bad press? Maybe this trick is not the best course, but I wouldn’t be totally opposed to exploring these dark arts a bit.

Supreme Court?,"When I mentioned my support for Pete, my friend said that him being POTUS would be awful because “his supreme court plan would basically put a permanent 10-5 right wing majority on the Supreme Court”. Is there any truth to this? If not, where might he have got this idea?

Important advice from Chasten," This is a quote from [Chasten's interview at NYU](https://funnny.substack.com/p/transcript-of-the-discussion-with) on May 2nd, I think it's is especially relevant right now: 

""So when the attacks come, and the hate mail and the death threats, and I start like \[thinking\] holy cow, we’ve really opened ourselves up to this scrutiny and this hate and this analyzation. Pete is literally the solace, he’s what gets me through it.  He’s always there with like a calm hand on your shoulder saying “it’s gonna be okay, this is why we’re doing it, this is why it matters... the rest of its noise” Don’t read the comment section, that’s my mantra. Everyone says that, but then they do. It’s like “don’t read the comments section... but I wanna know what people are saying.”

Read a book or get a mindfulness app on your phone or play a game. When you are tempted, if you see the garbage headline, the clickbait - when you are so tempted to click comments and watch the world burn, go do something else. Exit out of the app, talk to someone, call your mom. Literally do something else, because if we just sit here and focus on the vitriol and the hatred that’s happening on social media, especially when you’re two out gay men in Indiana, who are deciding to run for the presidency - well he’s running for president, not me  - **of course there’s gonna be hatred. And there will always be hatred if you go looking for it.""**",buttigieg,"Important advice from Chasten  This is a quote from [Chasten's interview at NYU](https://funnny.substack.com/p/transcript-of-the-discussion-with) on May 2nd, I think it's is especially relevant right now:

Crowd Sourcing Response Links to Eric Logan/Buttigieg Response,"So here is the deal, I think it would be beneficial to have a running list of links to counter any explicit falsehoods in the current full court media press against Pete. While much of what is being discussed are issues of judgement and perspective, a not insignificant portion is outright lies. This strategy has worked for us before- the 'Pete has no policies' meme died because it was easy to link to his policy page. The bad faith actors realized all they did was give us a platform to share his policies, and they moved on. So for that reason i'm throwing up what I've got to shut down the lies, not the criticism. What I am hoping someone else can find is

a) A source on pete not attending the vigil after being told not to by the community 

b)The quotes from Eric Logans family quieting hecklers/ defending petes right to speak during the protest. Preferably with a timestamped video. 

c)Local community leaders criticizing the coverage of the incident and response 

d)Any briefing on local SB/IN laws on what a mayor can/cannot do in regards to the police department

e)any other defenders, endorsements, or local voices from SB. 

There are a few important tweets from a local in SB claiming Regina Preston Williams organized a group to come and derail the townhall. I have taken to not directly linking to SB locals online because of those threats we heard about, but here are the tweets:

So ugh, yeah. If anyone has any links to the above, feel free to throw them down. Also, probably best to not engage on judgement calls right now. Just correct the lies and move on."
"On homelessness, town halls, and all the outrage [LONG RANT]","I hope this all makes sense; I'm pretty upset at the moment, so forgive me if this is a bit of a rant. And, before I say anything else, I want to stress that *there is real pain in South Bend*. There have been generations of racial inequity and injustice here. A man has died, and his family is grieving. Some of the anger directed at the mayor is genuine. Pete has heard these voices, and we need to take him at his word when he says he has failed at some of the things he has tried to do. He has failed at times, as all politicians have failed, even the best -- and it takes guts to say that.

Nevertheless, one of the strangest things as a South Bend resident, watching this pile-on to Pete, is how the media are picking up on some of the very worst and craziest voices in the community, and giving them a national platform. These are people who have hated Pete for years – and who never *dreamed* they would have the opportunity, at last, to do him real harm in front of the whole country.

A lot has been said about the townhall and the constant heckling there. It’s important to note that a lot (not all) of the loudest voices were white. Many black residents attended the meeting, and hoped to engage in real dialogue with the mayor. A few media outlets have quoted, in passing, their frustration at not being able to hear because of the “activists” in the back of the room. No media outlets have mentioned that many residents of South Bend recognized the activists, white and black, as denizens of the notorious Facebook group MiVoCAL (Michiana Voices of Community Activists and Leaders). It’s easy to find; go check it out. It’s a madhouse of anger and stupidity, almost entirely made up of extremists on the right and on the left, in a kind of unholy alliance. There’s always a few reasonable voices – I was there for a little while :-) – but the reasonable voices usually get barred pretty quickly from commenting (as I was, and many other people I know…). And these ""activists"" were out in force at the townhall, having organized its disruption on MiVOCAL.

But rather than wading into what happened at the townhall again, I want to consider the article published today in the New Yorker ([https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/what-pete-buttigieg-has-and-hasnt-done-about-homelessness-in-south-bend](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/what-pete-buttigieg-has-and-hasnt-done-about-homelessness-in-south-bend)) – because it’s connected. The person guiding the reporter around the homeless encampments is part of a noisy MiVoCAL subgroup obsessed with homelessness. About 2-3 years ago they started announcing on Facebook that they would be handing out food and drink at such-and-such a place, every week, and, lo and behold!, the homeless population swelled. The encampments under the Main St bridge, mentioned in the article, came into existence because the MiVOCAL group were going to Walmart and buying brand new tents and handing them out (and the activist in the article is still doing that for the new encampments further to the south). Suddenly the situation went from 3-4 old guys hanging out under the bridge to between 70 and 100, who ate and drank and then disappeared whenever the weather got wet or cold. This is my neighborhood, and it started to get *really* dangerous. These “activists” (most of whom do not live in South Bend, but in the suburbs) actively encouraged people to come live under the bridge as a way of ""raising awareness"" of homelessness, basically creating a place for addicts and drunks to show up, either from out of town or from inadequate housing situations in town. We simply didn't have so many homeless before they started; this is a manufactured problem, unconnected with the 1000 houses project (as the article tries to insinuate).

And given the larger context, it was easy to manufacture. One of the things that the article completely fails to mention is that Notre Dame set up a Center for the Homeless 30 years ago that's a national model for homeless treatment. However, when combined with the total apathy of every other (Republican) municipal and county government for 50 miles in every direction, it has made SB a magnet for the homeless. We have shelters, soup kitchens, treatment centers, day centers, weather amnesty, etc. All of those are good things! And Pete has supported and expanded all of them! But (and I really want to emphasize this) NO OTHER northern Indiana town has any support for the homeless. Other muncipalities literally buy their homeless a bus ticket to SB and say good riddance. So everybody comes to South Bend; the “activists” encourage the development of homeless encampments in the center of town; and then the same activists yell at Mayor Pete for not taking better care of them. It’s a problem that no amount of funding can fix, precisely because it’s being manufactured by this Facebook group to undermine the Dems.

The article makes a big deal about a report, a plan that would have fixed the homeless problem. This is not some authoritative state or federal study. The person who wrote this plan (cited in the article) is a private consultant whose livelihood is based on finding urban governments who will hire him to create a homeless plan. He got wind of the situation in SB, showed up, pitched his services to the city, and the city said “no thanks.” He's been loudly complaining ever since that he ""offered"" South Bend a solution (as though out of the goodness of his heart) which the city inexplicably refused. 

These folks are all connected to the same ""activists"" who showed up at the town hall yesterday and shouted the mayor down. I've been reading their facebook page, MiVOCAL,  for years and they all got together to celebrate yesterday just how bad they are making Pete look. It's exceptionally disheartening.

Again, I don’t want to detract from the real pain. Pete’s rightly acknowledged that. But he’s also had to stand there and take completely manufactured abuse. And he must know that and recognize these figures himself -- but he can hardly say that some of the outrage is from a group of perpetual agitators, who are either to the right of Trump or left of Bernie, and is not coming from a place of genuine feeling and conviction. So, I don’t know what the solution is. But ordinary people, of all backgrounds, here in SB are just despairing that the craziest amongst us are finally getting their day in the sun, thanks to a media that seems to want to find “evidence” to fit a prewritten narrative about Pete.",buttigieg,"On homelessness, town halls, and all the outrage [LONG RANT] I hope this all makes sense; I'm pretty upset at the moment, so forgive me if this is a bit of a rant.

Email from Pete: Safety and Justice Are Inseparable,"It’s been a week since a member of our South Bend family was shot and killed by a police officer.

I’ve held meetings with community members, the police department, and faith leaders. And yesterday, I held a community-wide town hall to discuss race and policing in our city, to make sure all residents could be heard. It was a tough conversation. Hearts are broken. My heart is broken.

It was a painful but needed conversation. And I feel overwhelmed and heartened by the number of people – supporters and critics – who have reached out and made it clear over the past week that they want to join hands and face these problems together.

Our American values are at stake in the need for us to address the deep mistrust of police and governments among communities of color, which flows directly from the consequences of systemic racism. The many well-intentioned steps we have taken, locally and across the country, have not succeeded. We have not done enough. I will be working with my team and community to build on what we have done together over the past few years. It is clear we need to implement bolder and more aggressive actions moving forward.

Communities and police departments across the nation are in crisis. We must bring about swift and deep change, refusing to rest until we live in a world where an American’s response to seeing or hearing a police car is no different whether they are Black or white: a feeling of safety, not fear.

Safety and justice are inseparable. Making them a lived reality for all is one of the great challenges of our time. And the solutions will have to come from cities like South Bend, where people are ready to come together to struggle and repair. I’m running for president as a mayor of an American city because the toughest issues we face locally are also important national issues. I get why people are not satisfied. I’m not either. This is why as mayors we have the opportunity to change the national conversation.

We must tackle the problem of racial inequity in our lifetime, otherwise it will undermine the entire project of America. The issue of systemic racism, and its effect on our institutions and relationships, has been created through centuries. Turning it around will take action, intention, and persistence. We can and must be the generation to finally do so.

One way we can support Pete right now besides a donation is to write a letter or a post card. I forget which user suggested postcards but it’s genius. Shows where we are all from and can be a short message of support, which I’m sure his staff will be grateful for too. It can be related to the shooting or not, but I think them arriving as the second quarter ends would be a great show of support for our guy.  can you imagine if over the next few days they received a couple hundred or so post cards? It would be great if everyone who writes one can comment on this or share your message so we can see how many went out! 

They can be sent to the campaign PO Box.

Mayor Pete's opportunity for transformational leadership.,"As a black queer millennial from the coast and a Pete supporter, i first connected with Mayor Pete from the way he flipped the religious narrative from the right into one that made sense for me as a progressive.

This week-end, I was thinking of the scripture in 1 Corinthians 10:13;

**""And God is faithful: He will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear,**

**but with the trial will also provide a way out so that you may be able to endure it.""**

I can't help but feel like there is reason for the trials that SB is going through. Maybe the national spotlight could be a blessing actually. Many cities in the US go through this every week, many black families loose their loved ones in the hands of police all the time.

The death of Eric Logan in SB however has the potential of ushering in if anything else a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. I see this as an opportunity for the country to put an honest discussion about the structural racism in the Police departments all over the country on the agenda of the 2020 campaign discussions as a priority not an afterthought.

Because of the many videos of police incidents we see every day, the society has become desensitized and the processes of accountability are not satisfactory to put it mildly.

Activists fight against a system not intended or willing to hear them and a perception by the white majority that this is not an issue at scale as it is portrayed. This leads to frustration and cynicism within communities of color because all that says is that no one really cares about black lives. This issue never seems to be a priority on the national level (Trump hasn't talked about this even once in his almost 3 years as president and the 2020 hopefuls just talk of Criminal Justice Reform but this issue specifically except for that time he called kneeling football players SOBs... ok i just remembered what is on the other side... God Help us).

We will see how serious the many democrats who have been signaling their commitments to policing reforms and social justice really are.

For the one Mayor Pete dealing with this directly, the situation reveals that the standard solutions are not enough. In the eyes of let's say an OBAMA DOJ, one would say that the police reforms Mayor Pete implemented were adequate (body cameras, transparency on Police department website, Mayor's nights out, majority black members on board of public safety that decides of police discipline, racial bias training...). However, this is obviously not enough, and many other cities that did more or less the same thing still have excessive use of force on black and brown people.

Then the immediate discussion comes to diversity of the police force, as older black officers retire, there is a trend in many cities that POC apply to be police officers but very few make it to the finish line. This is an issue that is not a SB only issue but that every city has to take accountability for and intentionnaly work to mitigate the issues that prevent the young applicants to be hired. Mayor Pete accepted that he tried and failed.

Given the national platform that Mayor Pete has by his candidacy he can emphasize that:

There is an **urgency to talk of a national diversity recruitment framework** that puts more pressure on states and local police departments to interest and recruit police officers as diverse as the communities they serve, if necessary, enforce quotas.

There is a big and **national issue of racism and dehumanization of black and brown lives** as seen by police. This is structural and won't be solved by one city. It is a fact that police knows how to deescalate when they are apprehending white people, so it is not a de-escalation training problem. It is made even worse when there is no accountability and prosecution for racist and violent cops. Mayor Pete can propel this in the national discussion and promote stricter discipline guidelines and enforceable federal oversight to local police teams to show a real course-correction.

The fact that **POC fear police all over the country** is a reality that not one city is going to solve, but this gives the opportunity once more to see and hear what black mothers feel for their boys and take action. Given that the police serves the community, on the federal level, we can talk of the ways communities can in a structured way be part of the hiring, firing and even training of the police officers as one example.

**one visible difference here:** most of the times without body camera video to see what happened with certitude, the victim is made to be a horrible person, robbed of his humanity and we just hear that side of the story on a loop. This time, mainly because Mayor Pete faced the real issue (not the alleged crime, but the murder and use of unnecessary force by the police officer), the country can have the correct discussion. The national media is caring about the case not because they care about the life of Mr Logan but because of Mayor Pete and the political implications. This is very cynical and sad but can be a blessing if Mayor Pete, by listening and letting his constituents talk and be heard on the national stage, by taking actions to bring accountability as soon as possible and by taking it upon himself to cary this burden and bring it to the forefront as a leader of a grieving community. He can be an example for the other white political leaders to fight for action and make solving this issue a priority. Within the generational framing of his candidacy, he can bring the urgency needed, that this has to be solved in our lifetime as he said today.

I have learned a lot about SB in the last months and i feel like his city is a microcosm of American beauty, diversity, hope, strength and of course systemic ills. Coming back to 1 Corinthians 10:13, the city is being tested but i trust that it can handle it and become a conduit for the country to start solving the plague that is racism in policing if only by the different angles that the narrative has taken this time and the special leader that they have.

If this sounds too hopeful, that is the level of hope that Mayor Pete inspires me,  I hope more of us are hopeful around here... I just opened a reddit account to say this.",buttigieg,"Mayor Pete's opportunity for transformational leadership.

However, this is obviously not enough, and many other cities that did more or less the same thing still have excessive use of force on black and brown people.

Then the immediate discussion comes to diversity of the police force, as older black officers retire, there is a trend in many cities that POC apply to be police officers but very few make it to the finish line. This is an issue that is not a SB only issue but that every city has to take accountability for and intentionnaly work to mitigate the issues that prevent the young applicants to be hired. Mayor Pete accepted that he tried and failed.

Given the national platform that Mayor Pete has by his candidacy he can emphasize that:

There is an **urgency to talk of a national diversity recruitment framework** that puts more pressure on states and local police departments to interest and recruit police officers as diverse as the communities they serve, if necessary, enforce quotas.

There is a big and **national issue of racism and dehumanization of black and brown lives** as seen by police. This is structural and won't be solved by one city. It is a fact that police knows how to deescalate when they are apprehending white people, so it is not a de-escalation training problem. It is made even worse when there is no accountability and prosecution for racist and violent cops. Mayor Pete can propel this in the national discussion and promote stricter discipline guidelines and enforceable federal oversight to local police teams to show a real course-correction.

The fact that **POC fear police all over the country** is a reality that not one city is going to solve, but this gives the opportunity once more to see and hear what black mothers feel for their boys and take action. Given that the police serves the community, on the federal level, we can talk of the ways communities can in a structured way be part of the hiring, firing and even training of the police officers as one example.

**one visible difference here:** most of the times without body camera video to see what happened with certitude, the victim is made to be a horrible person, robbed of his humanity and we just hear that side of the story on a loop. This time, mainly because Mayor Pete faced the real issue (not the alleged crime, but the murder and use of unnecessary force by the police officer), the country can have the correct discussion. The national media is caring about the case not because they care about the life of Mr Logan but because of Mayor Pete and the political implications. This is very cynical and sad but can be a blessing if Mayor Pete, by listening and letting his constituents talk and be heard on the national stage, by taking actions to bring accountability as soon as possible and by taking it upon himself to cary this burden and bring it to the forefront as a leader of a grieving community. He can be an example for the other white political leaders to fight for action and make solving this issue a priority. Within the generational framing of his candidacy, he can bring the urgency needed, that this has to be solved in our lifetime as he said today.

I have learned a lot about SB in the last months and i feel like his city is a microcosm of American beauty, diversity, hope, strength and of course systemic ills. Coming back to 1 Corinthians 10:13, the city is being tested but i trust that it can handle it and become a conduit for the country to start solving the plague that is racism in policing if only by the different angles that the narrative has taken this time and the special leader that they have.

If this sounds too hopeful, that is the level of hope that Mayor Pete inspires me,  I hope more of us are hopeful around here... I just opened a reddit account to say this."

Why Mayor Pete?,"Hey everyone, I was browsing the sub a lot yesterday and I didn’t really see what I’m looking for so I’m hoping this community can lend me a hand. I’m very involved with politics, but with the democratic field being so massive this election I feel like I’m falling behind. 

A little about me: I’m a student in the Midwest area, currently an avid Elizabeth Warren supporter. I was Feeling the Bern in 2016, but was not Bernie or Bust. I’m not super thrilled with his campaign this time around. I’m looking around at other alternative candidates in case the election goes in the thousands of different directions it could go. My family is pretty moderate, some swing conservative, some swing Democrat, I’m waaaaay to the left, progressive/liberal/etc. 

So what am I looking for? Well, I’m a student so college costs are a big part of my concern even if they won’t directly effect me. Followed by infrastructure and climate change plans - I’m going to graduate school for urban planning so I’m looking for things that would possibly be affecting my field (cost of housing, green development, sustainable living). 

I really want to know more about Pete, I plan on reading his book once I’m done reading Andrew Yang’s. I’m a big reader - so if there are **book suggestions**, not necessarily about Pete but about the things he’s talking about (Yang Gang has a booklist, don’t know if there’s something similar here).

How can non-Americans support Pete?,"I'm Dutch, but am convinced that the 2020 US presidential elections are going to be one of the most important events for the near future of humanity. 

The stance that your next president takes on human rights and climate change is going to affect *far* more than just the next four years, as it will determine whether the world (or at least the West) can stand behind America again. If we can't rely on America we turn to China, and that's not acceptable for obvious reasons (and has been happening a lot recently). Whatever the US presidency prioritizes quickly becomes a global issue, and for everyone's sake we need those priorities to be climate and democracy ASAP. 

Pete calling out Israel's human rights record and the cruelty of what's happening to Muslims in Xinjiang convinced me beyond all reason that the world desperately needs an America led by Pete. No other candidate seems to take such a strong stance on promoting democracy and human rights, which is just mind-boggling to me considering that's what the US was once famous for. He comes to his own informed conclusions, thinking way outside the box US politics has been living in. 

So... what can I do? Just plaster his face across social media so people can learn about him? 

Would also love to hear the thoughts of other non-americans.

He comes to his own informed conclusions, thinking way outside the box US politics has been living in. 

So... what can I do? Just plaster his face across social media so people can learn about him? 

Would also love to hear the thoughts of other non-americans.

Edit: thanks guys! Loving the enthusiasm. I'll make sure to upvote Pete stuff here and across Reddit and engage with people on Facebook etc"

Pete's Detailed Policy,"@cam_joseph: ""Following criticism for lack of specifics, @PeteButtigieg’s campaign has a more robust issues page. Campaign promises 'more detailed policy rollouts that drill down on specifics' in the coming weeks.""

Hey everyone, I was wondering if there is any word on the more detailed policies that Pete teased when he released his policy page. I know he has talked about foreign policy, which is good considering how little others in the primary tend to talk about foreign policy (which is objectively a huge part of being president).

But, I was really hoping for some policy details from him before the debate...in my ideal world, he and his team would decide what policies he wants to focus on, and have laws written and ready to present to Congress the day he is elected. I understand why that may be a bad move politically though (it's easier to attack a pay-for than a policy, so it's often good to keep the trade-offs a bit vague).

But, recently I I saw a Twitter thread where each candidate presented the details of their plans on climate change (one of Pete's big issues). Warren looked the best of everyone, with several well thought out ideas and a plan on how to pass them. Pete honestly was one of the worst looking candidates, offering very little real plan.

I love Pete, and I love his policy priorities. I guess I'm just really hoping they get some meat on them...unless I'm just missing these or something? I would even love little things detailed out - how are we going to approach election security? How much money will be put into it, how will that money be distributed, and what are a couple possible sources of that money? Things like that.",buttigieg,"Pete's Detailed Policy @cam_joseph: ""Following criticism for lack of specifics, @PeteButtigieg’s campaign has a more robust issues page.

The Biden pile-on begins...,"First: I'm against tearing down others for my own gain and I don't like politicians who do it either.  

So Biden made comments talking about working with segregationists to achieve some civil rights legislation.  He said it in the context of being able to work with an opposition without demonizing or tearing them down.  Ok.  But being Joe, he used a word that Corey Booker decided was offensive enough to attack Biden for.  Then Bernie Sanders joined Booker in attacking Biden - as did Elizabeth Warren, and finally Kamala Harris.  

I'm not a Biden supporter.  I'm on record here and elsewhere saying it was a mistake for him to get in the race.  I hope he drops out in fact.  But I really hope Pete keeps his hands clean and doesn't join in.  That's the point of my post.  Let the others attack each other over this if they want.  I think the better argument for Pete to make is that we need generational change.  I think he can make that argument better by showing he won't engage in the politics of personal destruction to see who can rise to the top of the pile.  

I only see this hurting those other candidates and helping Pete.  But only if he stays out of it.",buttigieg,"The Biden pile-on begins... First: I'm against tearing down others for my own gain and I don't like politicians who do it either.

"Over the past two weeks, I've gotten 13-15 people to donate to Pete.","Since the beginning of the month, I've gotten the following people to donate to Pete's campaign, some of them for the first time to a candidate *ever*: My mother; my sister; my grandmother; two aunts; one aunt's boyfriend; my cousin; my friend; his brother; his sister; his mother; two of my friend's co-workers; and possibly two strangers while raiding for Pokemon Go. Some of them did so *on the spot*, others asked for the best site to donate through to do later (and informed me when they did).

How did I accomplish this? Firstly, by waiting until discussion of the primaries and 2020 came up organically. Secondly, by talking about my excitement for Pete's campaign and what I think he represents. Thirdly, after piquing their interests with *my* interest, telling them how Pete was the first (presidential) candidate I've ever donated to personally. And finally, if they expressed positive attitudes toward Pete but reluctance to spend money on a candidate, telling them that the number of donors is as important as the amount of money made total, and informing them that even low dollar amounts, like $3-$5, have an impact. I would then tell or show them how easy ActBlue is to use, and also tell them that, compared to candidates like Beto (whose email list I'm on) or Bernie, Pete's campaign doesn't constantly bombard you with pleas for donations. They all seemed to like that part.

I've just been thinking, the end of the 2nd quarter is coming up, and we have the opportunity to help Pete end it with a bang. I challenge everyone here to get as many other people as they can to donate to the campaign over the next 11 days. Talk to your friends and family. Nothing gets people excited about a cause or candidate like seeing someone else excited about them. Just avoid being preachy, and make the act of supporting him seem easy and low-pressure.

Oh, and if you, yourself, haven't donated yet this quarter, there's a link off to the side there [(and here, *hint hint*)](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/reddit-for-pete).

Lets talk about Pete and local South Bend news,"**What brought this up**

As most of you are aware, there was a fatal shooting in South Bend earlier this week involving a South Bend Police Officer.  With Pete's surging popularity, this local story has been brought immediately to the national attention.  There have been many posts over the last few days about this issue and it some are following the happenings pretty closely.

&amp;#x200B;

**What we're here for**

The reason we are here is because I think we all want to see Pete Buttigieg as the next President of the United States.  I see a lot of discussion praising Pete, but also serious discussions on how we feel he should handle certain topics and policies.  Because Pete is currently the Mayor of South Bend, IN I believe, along with many others, that the way he handles local issues is a very good way for all of us to translate how he may handle national issues.

&amp;#x200B;

**What the problem is**

As I mentioned above, following South Bend local news pertaining to Pete is an excellent way to figure out what sort of President he will be, but we have to remember that some of the news is very personal and can really hit home with many people, even here in r/Pete_Buttigieg.  While there is no problem discussing matters like the events of this week and how it pertains to the national issues, the coverage from media outlets can have very different perspectives depending on whether the sources are local to South Bend or not.

&amp;#x200B;

**Going forward**

The team has discussed how to handle discussion and coverage of local South Bend news, especially within the context of sensitive stories like the one this week.  We feel that going forward, we would love to see continued discussion around how Pete handles this issue in relation to his campaign and hopefully his Presidency.  Any discussion about events itself may be better suited for r/SouthBend.  To help facilitate this, we have decided we will allow sources at a national or non-local level to be posted in regards to local South Bend news.  If the source of your post is a local South Bend news source, the mod team will reserve the right to remove the post based on relevancy to Pete and his campaign.  If your post is removed under this criteria, feel free to head to r/SouthBend for discussion of the topic there.

&amp;#x200B;

We feel /u/genx1971 put it best.

&gt;This is a horrible event in a community. As tempting as it may be, Pete  supporters who are not from South Bend should stay out of the  conversation on Twitter and FB as hard as that may be. And it will be  hard. I hadn’t seen much blowback on Mayor Pete until the news of the  body cam came out. Like it or not, fair or not he is going to take heat  for this and we won’t help by trying to plead a case for him. A man lost  his life, there is a distrust with the police as there is all over  America and while Pete’s administration has done some great things (like  get the body cams to begin with) we have to let the city grieve and  process on their own. Whether this makes, breaks or has no impact on  Pete’s campaign won’t be decided by getting into the tussle on social  media. Pete’s leadership and how his community receives that will be the  test.

Please give them a click for good journalism.

*After their participation in the first Democratic presidential debate, the percentage of Latinos interested in voting in the primary for the senator from California has risen considerably. And the candidate also has an interest in winning over the community in states where she has political weight.*

Kamala Harris aims to win the support of minorities to achieve the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. Hispanics, especially in states such as Nevada, could give you a considerable advantage when you start primary.

Nevada - although it has only 36 delegates - is the fourth primary in the electoral calendar and that gives it enormous symbolic importance. The Harris campaign knows this, as well as 29% of the population of the state is Latino.

So far the senator has visited that state in the west of the country five times in her campaign for the nomination. Although without concrete numbers to quantify the effect and importance that the campaign gives to this group, nor the level of investment that is dedicated to it, sources in the team of Harris assure that one of the main focuses in the state has focused on the young Hispanics, the LatinX generation.

The campaign has hired Spanish speaking organizers east of Las Vegas, a predominantly Latino area of ​​the city, although they did not detail how many.

But beyond Nevada, other states such as Texas, Colorado and California - at stake March 3 in the so-called Super Tuesday - are areas where the Hispanic population also has a 
substantial presence.

Texas currently has a 39.6% Latino population, followed by California with 39.3% and Colorado with 21.7%. 
Harris already has the comparative advantage in California that gives her being a senator by state since 2003 and has been a general prosecutor, something that helps her tremendously by making her a face known to local voters.

Texas and Colorado are hard to win, especially since other candidates like Beto O'Rourke and Julián Castro play locals in the state of the lonely star, as happens with Michael Bennet in Colorado. But that does not discourage Harris's team.

The senator put on her team Emmy Ruiz, political strategist, former state director for Nevada and Colorado in the campaign of Hillary Clinton, who is now one of its main advisers.

""It's early and we're still growing. In 2018 we saw that the Latino community will be a group of voters that will come out in a surprising way. We have started working in Nevada and California where there is a strong Hispanic population, we have begun to ensure that the people of the campaign give priority and within the next few months they will be one of the focuses of our investment, ""Juan Rodríguez told Univisión. director of the Harris campaign.

According to Albert Morales, political director of Latino Decisions, a political research and advisory firm focused on the Hispanic community, the Latino vote in the Democratic primary is now more important than ever.

""Historically when we've asked people if they intend to vote during the primary, the number is always an average of 40 to 50% among registered Latino voters. That number since last year has changed. 83% of Hispanics plan to vote in the presidential primaries according to a survey we conducted last March. Something never seen. The people are mobilized, ""he told Univisión Noticias.

**Why Harris?**

After the first Democratic debate, Harris managed to greatly strengthen his position among Latinos, who until that time were supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.

A survey carried out by Univision Noticias after the confrontation carried out in Miami , showed that 22% of the participants said that they were planning to vote for the senator from California, 18% inclined for Julián Castro and 16% for Joe Biden.

The results showed a significant change compared to support for the legislator before the first debate, where she only achieved 6% of preferences among Latinos.

Last February Harris secured the support of activist Dolores Huerta, a recognized figure in the world of union rights for farmworkers, and a strong voice to publicize her image among Latinos.

""When I was a district attorney in San Francisco there was a big protest and they arrested a lot of people, about 200 people. A person who worked in his office told me that she just arrived at her post she requested all the files of the people who arrested for the protest and said 'Let's see how we drop the charges'. Kamala sympathizes a lot with working people. We can have confidence in her, ""Huerta told Univisión Noticias.

Huerta insisted that although Harris is not Hispanic compared to other candidates like Castro, the senator is a stronger and more experienced candidate.

""All are good candidates Castro, Elizabeth Warren, but Harris has shown that she has a lot of courage, she has experience as a procurator, but above all she is someone who has compassion for people, especially workers and immigrants,"" Huerta said.

Harris also placed Latinos in key positions in his campaign such as Rodriguez and Ruiz.

""One of the things Kamala did since we started the campaign was to make sure it was diverse, that the community had a voice when we are making decisions,"" Rodriguez said.

**Hispanic Agenda**

Harris has worked hard to project a pro-immigration image, a point he hopes will help her in recruiting the Latino vote.

From her seat in the Senate and as a candidate she has launched strong criticisms of Donald Trump's immigration policy and has opposed financing the wall that the president promises to build on the border with Mexico.

The theme comes from personal experience: the senator is the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, what her campaign highlights as an advantage to connect with Latinos.

Rodríguez told Univisión Noticias that Harris understands the priorities among the Hispanic community and does not just limit his agenda to immigration when he speaks to Latinos.

""Our strategy has to be connected with the issues that are affecting our families and not just immigration. My parents are immigrants and when I was growing up they did not just talk about immigration, but about how to pay the bills at the end of the month. That's what the salary increases for teachers and tax cuts that Kamala talks about are discussed, ""Rodriguez explained.

Democratic strategists such as Luis Miranda, say that despite the efforts of the Harris campaign to Hispanics, there are alliances that are difficult to break and that could entail the Senator's path in its conquest by the vote of the community in the primaries .

""One of the important factors of the most recent CNN poll is that the African-American electorate still favors Biden over Harris,"" explains Miranda.

""Among the minority groups there is a kind of coalition that needs to be developed and that takes a long time. Years pass for the candidates to achieve it. Biden has spent many years with African-American, Latino communities, that's hard to change. ""

""Those communities, at least in the early stage of the primaries are going to keep more or less firm with those they already know and trust,"" says the Hispanic exporter of President Barack Obama.

Seven months from the start of the Democratic primaries and still with six pending debates, candidates still have a long way to go to get the nomination, but certainly those who manage to seduce Latinos in the months left in 2019 will be closer to achieve a convincing triumph and a good base for the general election.",kamala,"The surprise rise of Kamala Harris among Hispanic voters This is a (surprisingly coherent) google translation of this univision article. https://www.univision.com/noticias/elecciones-en-eeuu-2020/el-sorpresivo-ascenso-de-kamala-harris-entre-los-votantes-hispanos.

integrity... imagine that,"So I have Asperger's, which means I often miss social cues, especially non-verbal.

Met My Hero!,"This Saturday I had the pleasure of meeting my hero at Manny's. I was one of the few to get a picture and I was so f'ing happy. My hair and makeup were done and I've been #kamala2020 since 2016. When I walked away and realized the picture was blurry I literally teared up. I never considered on Sunday I'd have another chance but I got my pic with Kamala, this time with no make-up, hair up and honestly, just looking awful. I was so happy to get it but it's painful for me to look at because I've gained 60 pounds in the past 2 years. Saturday there was dimmer light and I was wearing a black shirt so it was more forgiving and flattering. I would pay top dollar for another opportunity but don't know if that will happen. At least I got to meet my hero but also sad.

http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100SB1317

I'm particularly interested in this section (emphasis mine):


&gt;(2) [...] **Under existing law**, the parent or guardian of a pupil, who is subject to compulsory full-time education or to compulsory continuation education, whose child is habitually truant, as defined, or fails to perform his or her duty to compel attendance of the pupil, is guilty of a crime.

&gt;This bill would provide that a parent or guardian of a pupil of 6 years of age or more who is in kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 8, inclusive, and who is subject to compulsory full-time education or to compulsory continuation education, whose child is a chronic truant, who has failed to reasonably supervise and encourage the pupil’s school attendance, and who has been offered language accessible support services to address the pupil’s truancy, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,000, or by imprisonment in a county jail for a period not exceeding one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment. 

Am I reading this correctly....that truancy was **already** a crime, punishable up to a year in prison?

&gt;The bill would authorize a superior court to establish a deferred entry of judgment program, meeting specified conditions, to adjudicate cases involving parents or guardians of elementary school pupils who are chronic truants. **The bill would authorize a deferred entry of judgment program established under the bill to refer defendant parents or guardians for services, including, but not necessarily limited to, case management, mental and physical health services, parenting classes and support, substance abuse treatment, and child care and housing.** The bill would authorize the deferment of entry of judgment in these cases upon the defendant’s compliance with terms and conditions set forth by the court. The bill would require that funding for the deferred entry of judgment program come solely from nonstate sources.


...So the only thing this bill does is create a *support* system for families who's children are truant? I'm not a lawyer so clarification is welcome.",kamala,"Delving into It took forever to locate this, since it is never linked in the anti-Kamala hit pieces.

Regarding the viral hate tweets,"Does anyone have any positive tweets I can retweet of Kamala regarding her record? I want the people that follow me to get another perspective and I’m not good at putting things into words to make my own tweet.

I hate how misinformation spreads so much. It’s like people always find a way to vilify female candidates. It doesn’t feel like healthy research on a candidate, it feels like some of these people feel absolute hatred and need reasons to justify it. Kamala is a great woman who wants to and can fight for us and seeing these tweets get so many likes and retweets, especially by people I know, hurts my heart. It’s going to be my first time voting for president (wasn’t old enough in 2016) and I’m so excited to vote for her. But the support these tweets are getting just makes me so angry and like I’m going to have to go on the defensive when I tell people I support her.

Hopefully, the phrase “Twitter isn’t real life” applies here more than ever. She’s rising in the polls. But I just hope these things don’t spread enough to hurt her.

"the insult ""corporate democrat"" your perspective on it?","I wanted to refine this post. Asking about why the Left has continued to go into the route of conspiracy theories? That was a trademark and past time of the right wing and still is, but now after the 2016 DNC its assumed anyone who's not Bernie Sanders is a corporate democrat who will continue to feed the parasitic wealthy. I can go on all day about how these people don't understand economics, I have a valuable playlist of economic videos if you're interested, PM me for them if you're interested. I digress.

I used to be big into conspiracy culture and know the tricks of the trade. You start at your conclusion and create your own evidence from there. I understand that there are a few candidates taking PAC money. I know Biden and Buttigeg are the known ones, possibly Elizabeth Warren too. It takes time to find this information out, we should be investigating instead of pointing fingers. I am satisfied to know that Kamala isn't taking corporate money. She is working with a **former Well's Fargo CEO ,**  I have no issue with that to an extent. 

I understand the difference between a politician cheating and using a financial racket and a politician who is playing by the rules and is understanding that in order to beat the system, you need to beat them at their own games and go from there. 

I am thinking about really quitting most alternative news channels. I'm not glorifying the MSM in anyway, but to disregard all MSM is not rational. I am thinking about dropping Jimmy Dore. I dropped Young Turks years ago, that place is a dumpster fire. I might stay with Kyle Kulinski not sure. These channels have said some lies about Kamala Harris and I find it disgusting they're not giving her a chance when there's nothing dirty about here? There are criticisms yes, but to point fingers at candidates who have done nothing wrong is lying and I don't want to be a part of that.

I mentioned a lot of fluff as it appears, but I needed to elaborate to get my point across about how the term corporate democrat is used. Let me know what you think? The democratic party should be the rational ones. We're not crazy theocratic lunatics and we should lead by example, no wonder the Republicans have had easy victories these past several years.",kamala,"the insult ""corporate democrat"" your perspective on it? I wanted to refine this post. Asking about why the Left has continued to go into the route of conspiracy theories? That was a trademark and past time of the right wing and still is, but now after the 2016 DNC its assumed anyone who's not Bernie Sanders is a corporate democrat who will continue to feed the parasitic wealthy. I can go on all day about how these people don't understand economics, I have a valuable playlist of economic videos if you're interested, PM me for them if you're interested. I digress.

I used to be big into conspiracy culture and know the tricks of the trade. You start at your conclusion and create your own evidence from there. I understand that there are a few candidates taking PAC money. I know Biden and Buttigeg are the known ones, possibly Elizabeth Warren too. It takes time to find this information out, we should be investigating instead of pointing fingers. I am satisfied to know that Kamala isn't taking corporate money. She is working with a **former Well's Fargo CEO ,**  I have no issue with that to an extent.

I may be breaking the first rule with this post, but I think after last night and our growth I might be able to get a pass haha

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so happy to see so many new subscribers after seeing our Queen kill it last night. I think I speak for everyone in saying that we all want to see this sub continue to grow so we can build a real grassroots movement for Kamala. We are still small compared to some other candidates, but obviously we are growing and should expect even more people to join the more the media keeps talking about her (which they will!)

&amp;#x200B;

We should all focus on spreading the word about Kamala and this sub, while keeping this sub active and communicating and talking with other supporters. I love seeing all the new action, the memes, the articles, it's great! I think the most important things to do for us is to continue to keep the conversation going, by growing and keeping active our community here, but also advertising for Kamala elsewhere. Be sure to try to keep it as positive as possible and not attack other candidates and users. We want to talk about the good of Kamala, not get into a food fight with some internet strangers.

We are still small compared to some other candidates, but obviously we are growing and should expect even more people to join the more the media keeps talking about her (which they will!)

&amp;#x200B;

We should all focus on spreading the word about Kamala and this sub, while keeping this sub active and communicating and talking with other supporters. I love seeing all the new action, the memes, the articles, it's great! I think the most important things to do for us is to continue to keep the conversation going, by growing and keeping active our community here, but also advertising for Kamala elsewhere. Be sure to try to keep it as positive as possible and not attack other candidates and users. We want to talk about the good of Kamala, not get into a food fight with some internet strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you can **PLEASE DONATE!!!!! LINK:**  [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kdh-q1-website](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kdh-q1-website)

&amp;#x200B;

So excited for everyone here new and old, let's keep growing and most importantly let's get Kamala elected!

&amp;#x200B;

I think it'd be great if anyone had suggestions or ideas or anything to mention them here. The more conversation and discussion we have, the better!"

2.  Does Kamala Harris support federally mandated school busing for desegregation now? If not, why not?

Why I don’t believe in the gender pay gap and still agree with Kamala’s gender pay gap policy,"I study business and economics in college (I’m not making myself an authority on the issue) and I cannot understand why a business wouldn’t choose to hire only or mostly women if they could pay them 20% less than men. Companies like Aldi, dollar tree and Walmart keep their costs as low as possible in all aspects of their business and if they could lower their staff costs by 15-20% they would do it in a heartbeat. 

Having said that, I 100% agree with Kamala’s gender pay gap policy. I heard her talking about the gender pay gap on the Colbert show and I initially sighed because I thought she was pandering to the uninformed but when I heard her policy it made complete sense. If you haven’t heard of it, it legally obligates companies to prove they are paying women and men the same amount for the same job. I already believe that women are paid the same as men for the same job so if I’m right, almost no companies will be prosecuted by this and I will happily accept I’m wrong if this is not the case. 

Overall, I feel Kamala is pandering to feminists who wouldn’t vote for Biden to make herself an ideal running mate but I think she’s a smart dude and doesn’t believe in the gender pay gap herself.",kamala,"Why I don’t believe in the gender pay gap and still agree with Kamala’s gender pay gap policy I study business and economics in college (I’m not making myself an authority on the issue) and I cannot understand why a business wouldn’t choose to hire only or mostly women if they could pay them 20% less than men.

That involves signing executive orders requiring near-universal background checks on gun sales, closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole,"" reversing the Trump administration's move to allow fugitives with outstanding arrest warrants to buy guns, and repealing a law that prevents victims from holding gun-makers and firearms dealers liable for their losses

Rant on Impeachment,"I do NOT want to suck up all of the oxygen between now and 2020 on impeachment. If it were to go forward...we will be in a position where in approximately June of 2020 the Republican controlled senate will clear Trump, creating a fresh new wave of ""exoneration"" spin which will continue to muddy the waters through to the election.

There is NOTHING Trump would welcome more than an impeachment circus, and can you expect the media to collectively orgasm at the prospect of dropping everything (including the threadbare coverage of women candidates) to breathlessly air hours upon hours of Kelly-Ann Conway spin and futile Bernie/Biden bluster. Why would you hire a panel to discuss subtle policy issues when you could just have Andersen Cooper or Jake Tapper furrow their brows for 10 hours a day at how ""this is not normal""?

Anyone who thinks the lukewarm bullshit in the Mueller report will break the solidarity in the GOP is in an absolute fantasy world. Oh, so the administration is full of liars, enablers, and criminals. Was there anyone on God's green earth that wasn't aware of this already? THIS HAS BEEN THE MAIN FEATURE OF THE TRUMP APPEAL SINCE DAY FUCKING ONE. Running roughshod over ethics, tradition, and liberal feels is exactly WHY Trump was elected, why the fuck do people not get this yet? 

Expecting some Deus ex Machina like Mueller, Rosenstein, John McCain, Barr et. al. to end Trump was always the wrong strategy. House panels, state AGs, and investigative reporters should continue to run up the tally of evidence, so that Trump can be hounded by the consequences until his final days. But let that shit run on background until we break the fever of non-stop Trump fixation, and refocus the conversation on our worthy candidates for President.

Cory Booker Appears To Call Out Kamala Harris’s Marijuana Jokes,"It's better to tell the truth. She did make light of it and maybe she could have answered the question better.

Harris is for the legalization of marijuana. She sign on to  the Marijuana Justice Act.   Harris said ─“we don’t study it though, and we don’t legalize it, we can’t study it.”

Rallies/Fundraisers,"Just posting this as food for thought for Kamala and her team. One thing I noticed Bernie Sanders did in 2016 and he is doing it again this time is that he doesn’t do small fundraisers; he does free rallies. He sends out emails and posts on the event section of his Facebook page about a week or less before a rally (and he does rallies nearly every weekend in order to visit every state), The FB posts have an RSVP to give if you plan to attend. Then, if the crowd gets too big for the chosen rally site, the campaign finds a bigger site. Doing this gets people all over the country excited to get to see their candidate and they end up falling in love with and becoming a regular donor to the campaign. That is how Bernie built his base and it was very effective. It was appealing to all classes of people bc anyone could go see their candidate since it was free! People became very invested in the campaign. I understand raising money by doing the regular-type fundraisers, but I hope Kamala also starts doing these types of rallies! They win the hearts of the people and everybody wants to get involved with the campaign. Anyway- I love Kamala. She takes all of the best policy positions, she is a positive and inspiring candidate, and it is beyond time for a female president (and a minority female is even better)! #Kamala2020",kamala,"Rallies/Fundraisers Just posting this as food for thought for Kamala and her team.

Let's remember that we're primary opponents and the GOP is the enemy.,"Obvious Bernie supporter here. I expect nothing less than a very spirited competition for the nomination with Kamala supporters. 

When it's all over some of us are going to be extremely disappointed. 

Let's keep in mind that everyone on Reddit is invisible and there will be bad people masquerading as supporters in both of our camps who want to divide us from the larger goal of defeating the GOP and addressing critical issues like climate change and health care. 

It's important that we remember when we vote in November 2020 that we are voting for the candidate, not their sometimes unruly or Russian planted divisive supporters. 

If Kamala wins, I may not be thrilled. But I'll energetically support her and come out and vote for her in the general election in my swing state. 

We need to obliterate the GOP. 

Invisible people are going to say a lot of ugly things on the internet. Some with the express intent of dividing us. Putin isn't going to quit and there will also be genuine supporters on both sides who say things out of anger. 

Let's not fall for it. Let's obliterate the GOP in 2020.

texting for the campaign AMA!,"# Want to know anything about sending texts for Elizabeth Warren?

u/UNsoAlt and I have been talking about doing a little informal AMA about texting for a little while now so now I'm jumping in and doing it!

**About me:** I texted for Cynthia Nixon's gubernatorial campaign last year and I enjoyed doing it so much, I immediately signed up with the Warren campaign as soon as I could. I've been sending texts for the campaign since May. I don't know how many people I've texted so far but I've texted close to 3000+ folks just this month so far so maybe like 20k people so far?

**Caveats:** I don't work for the campaign, I don't speak for them in any capacity, anything I say is just my personal experience as a volunteer!

Elizabeth Warren Will Deny Federal Contracts to Companies With Poor Diversity and Equal Pay Policies,,warren,Elizabeth Warren Will Deny Federal Contracts to Companies With Poor Diversity and Equal Pay Policies 
Warren got busing right over 40 years ago.,"In the article, Warren predicted that de facto segregation -- segregation that occurs not because it was institutionalized by the government but because of social norms, prejudices and self-selection -- and de jure -- segregation that existed because of laws that mandated racial segregation -- had been silently ""reaffirming"" by the court and would take over American public schools.

The isolation of minorities in urban centers, Warren wrote, and a shrinking tax base to finance public education would lead to facilities that are inferior in ""student-teacher ratios, and other educational advantages"" for minority students. For Brown v. Board of Education to have meaning in northern urban centers, Warren said that ""effectively separate schools, even if equal, and certainly if unequal, are condemned by the Constitution, regardless of the reason for the separation.""

""It has been black parents, children, and organizations committed to desegregation who have shouldered the major part of the burden...Clearly, the burden for enforcing the Brown right has been misplaced,"" Warren wrote.

Warren wrote that the Milliken ruling, coupled with another ruling that upheld the state system of financing public schools by local taxes, ""will lead to central-city schools which are inferior in facilities, student-teacher ratios, and other educational advantages because the funding is not commensurate with that available for suburban schools.""

NYT Article: 'The Black Vote Is Not Monolithic' - Important to remember this and to watch how we talk about real people.," [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/us/politics/black-voters-south-carolina-democrats-primary.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/us/politics/black-voters-south-carolina-democrats-primary.html) 

&gt;It is what elevates Mr. Biden above his 22 Democratic rivals; though he is often portrayed as a champion of the white working class, he is viewed by many black voters as the play-it-safe choice who could best recreate the multiracial Obama coalition.  
&gt;  
&gt;But many young black voters are drawn to Elizabeth Warren and her plan to cancel student debt, while others prefer Bernie Sanders and his calls for systemic change. Some black women like Kamala Harris’s leadership style and her personal story as a graduate of Howard University. And some black men are sizing up Cory Booker, who employs the cadences of the black church in his stump speech.

There was a recent post on this sub asking how to solve the (not my words) ""minority problem:"" That is, how to steal black voters away from Harris without also being black. 

Lets always keep in mind that demographics are full of real people, not mindless voting blocs. When we talk about how to ""appeal to the black voter,"" we need to first and foremost humanize them and not treat them as data. I think Warren has this attitude, but some of her supporters could learn to be better about this. Black people aren't a problem to be solved and we have to accept that some will vote for Warren, but some will not for various reasons (sometimes that reason is simply that they prefer someone black to represent them).",warren,"NYT Article: 'The Black Vote Is Not Monolithic' - Important to remember this and to watch how we talk about real people.

What qualities should Warren's running mate have?,"I've heard a few people mention that Harris would be a good choice but I don't remember the last VP pick that was a Tier 1 opponent during the primary. I think VPs should have asymmetrical personalities and strengths and the main race is not the best place to look for that. Consider how Pence balanced Trump as one example.

What qualities would you like to see in Warren's running mate and why? My thoughts

* A man to balance the ticket in terms of electability
* A white man. I hate to say it but too much diversity at once could put the swing states on edge
* A moderate also for in party unity
* Seen as the ""bro you could have a beer with"" to counter the elitest narrative that may come into play against Warren
* A member of an opposing native American tribe to draw the vote from reserves across the country. Just kidding...
* Should have a long record in Congress or state government to balance against Warren's newness, ala Obama's Biden
* Track record should include some business friendly ""red tape"" cutting policies to bolster a pragmatic, get things done character arc
* Strong track record of fundraising. Trump is a monster here. Warren's own treasury should be vast to give up no ground anywhere
* Bonus: Makes it really hard for at least one of PA, OH or FL to vote the other way (I assume WI and MI are likely to come back to the D)",warren,"What qualities should Warren's running mate have?

How to reach Warren Campaign? Veteran Issue,"US Air Force vet here.

I am filled with a deep and visceral anger because I cannot speak to anyone with accountability about this. My best friend advised me to write Warren, our preferred candidate, and I am unsure how to reach out.

The issue:

The Trump administration has politicized the National celebration for American Independence. July 4th has turned into yet another celebration of the pseudogreatness of the vainglorious President. My brothers and sisters in arms are not or are unable to protest their use as nothing more than political pawns to stroke the ego of Donald John Trump. I am a disabled veteran, my knees irreparably damaged by my service.

The fact that this President is letting any organization, in this case the RNC, SELL FUCKING TICKETS to what should be a typical parade celebrating unity has turned it into a de facto fundraiser for Republican interests. The result is literally a UCMJ violation, in that US armed forces are barred from attending political events in uniform. It fills me with a sense of rage and disgust that is beyond words.

I need to ask Warren what she would do differently. I know she is a better candidate, I know she is a better person, and I know she is not accountable for this, but I need to hear it from the horse's mouth, so to speak, that our politics will be better. I need to hear that my and my friends' sacrifices are worth more than exploitation.

Any help in this endeavour would be greatly appreciated. I cannot just ask the SecDef, POTUS, VP, etc because those with accountability simply don't care about someone like me. My voice is effectively on mute.

Maybe here, it won't be.",warren,"How to reach Warren Campaign? Veteran Issue US Air Force vet here.

FYI: Polling Data Is Now Collected Online and Via Cell Phone,"Recently I have noticed a talking point on the far left that polling data is skewed toward older and more conservative voters. The argument typically made is that polling data is only collected through land lines, older people are most likely to have those, and therefore, polling data skews to that demographic. 

This is blatantly no longer true and hasn’t been for several years now. Last month I reviewed methodologies of five major pollsters RCP is using to compute their aggregate polling data. I’ve copied below how they survey respondents: 

&gt; The Monmouth University Poll was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute from June 12 to 17, 2019 with a national random sample of 751 adults age 18 and older, in English. This includes 301 contacted by a live interviewer on a landline telephone and 450 contacted by a live interviewer **on a cell phone.**

60% are contacted via cell. 

https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_061919/

&gt; This survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted between June 11 and June 15, 2019, and is based on live telephone interviews of adults 18 years of age or older, residing in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. **Quota and demographic information—including region, race, and age—were determined from national census data.** Samples of both standard landlines and cell phones were called using a probability-proportionate-to-size method, which means that the phone numbers assigned to each state were proportional to the number of adult residents in each state. 

https://www.suffolk.edu/academics/research-at-suffolk/political-research-center/polls/national

In this one the respondents are required to come close to census data.

&gt; The June 14-15 Hill-HarrisX poll **was conducted online among a statistically representative sample** of 424 respondents who identified themselves as registered voters who were Democrats or independents who favored the Democratic Party.

"Warren, Endorsements, and 2016: ""Because of the Implication""","A lot of complaints about Warren's part in 2016 stem from a fundamental misunderstanding about how government works and how difficult it is to be above board in all things. That quote in the title is mine, and stems from what I know of how hard it is to avoid even the implication of bribery or corruption. My father worked both in National Labs and at the DoE, and had to avoid even the implication that someone was trying to influence his work. So a $15 lunch out from friends wasn't allowed. A nice box of chocolates was cutting it fairly close. A cookbook could be right out. ""Because of the implication.""

&amp;#x200B;

In 2015, Warren was still in her first Senate term, and had run on an anti-corruption platform. So, when the Democratic primaries rolled around and Warren stayed away from internal politics, refused to endorse Sanders or Clinton, and stuck to the issues, she was called a coward. From what I can tell, these absurd claims stem from the fact that Sanders voters are young, and don't really understand how power or media impressions really work in politics. They've been led to believe that stepping into any given fray is a binary question instead of a complex calculation. Their vision for America is, to put it bluntly, naive and based on easily digested political concepts that belie the true nature of bureaucracy. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how do we teach critics of Warren's wisdom that running in a race isn't a binary decision? That endorsing in races comes with costs and questions everyone must be willing to face, and thus must be done with a careful, studious eye. Not just for our own campaign's sake, but for the sake of party unity and the best steps forward the left can take to win these fights, how do we teach nuance to those who are angry, impatient, and disaffected?",warren,"Warren, Endorsements, and 2016: ""Because of the Implication"" A lot of complaints about Warren's part in 2016 stem from a fundamental misunderstanding about how government works and how difficult it is to be above board in all things.

Economic/Social Policy Question,"Hi people,

I really love Warrens policies: A big tax increase on the super rich is the right thing, healthcare is obvious, cancellation of student loan debt and much more. She was always one of my top choices and i am considering to fully switch to her camp.

&amp;#x200B;

What i would like to know is what her stance on unconditional guaranteed minimum income or universal basic income is and if she has ever mentioned anything similar in that direction, since automation is a real thing and is coming on a major scale pretty soon.

"Warren is far more media savvy than I expected her to be, and ultimately I think thats her greatest strength","As much as we like to gush about how Warren is the policy candidate, I think we should recognize that it is just branding. Warren definitely has the best housing policy, but overall, her policy positions are mostly just above average in comparison to the average democratic candidate. Biden, the candidate who is seen as being bereft of policy, has by far the best climate change policy, and julian castro and beto surpass her on immigration imo. 

Don't get me wrong, I think she's great on policy, but so are a lot of democrats. Her true strength lies in the fact that she can get the media itself to focus on policy, an area where democrats are more popular than republicans on. Hillary had tons of policy (oftentimes great policy) but she wasn't really capable of making the media listen to it. The media is too easily baited by dumb culture war issues which simply divide the country along partisan lines (something which inherently benefits republicans). I think Warren's greatest case for electability is that she can get the media to focus on issues beneficial to Dems.

What do you think are Warren's weak areas?,"I'm definitely a 100% Warren supporter, but we all know her strengths whether it be her experience, policies, or speaking acumen. I'm curious to hear what some of you think her weak points are, or areas she's lacking in either experience, policies, or personality traits? I will say I haven't seen a lot of talk from her on foreign relations, and while certainly anyone will be better than trump in this area, I've read analysis that our allies will be more cautions dealing with us regardless of who is elected, knowing that we could elect some nutcase who just does away with alliances and agreements.

The debates are not even debates. Fixing it could be so easy too.,"the debates are just really shitty town halls with some added loud banter occasionally.

Starting at one end, each candidate gets 30 seconds to ask another candidate a question. That candidate gets 45 seconds to answer. ALL MICS ARE CUT except the 1 person who is suppose to be speaking. This is the whole debate. No moderators, just 1 guy making sure the right mics are on. 

I feel this would solve so many issues we have with the 'debates'. 
We would cut out a lot of the unnecessary questions. We got a lot of the same vague descriptions of random 0% candidate's plan on 'day 1' this and that because of what the moderators asked. Instead candidates could draw contrast much more easily if they are asking the questions of each other.

Some people I know IRL say this might hurt the 0%ers cause they would get fewer questions but I think this is ridiculous. Yang got what 2 questions? Did delaney get more than that? I feel being able to ask 5+ questions would help you stand out a lot more than stump slogans for healthcare, immigration, etc..  They could even ask raise your hand questions of all candidates to help them stand out on what they feel are their strengths.

OH AND ONE MORE THING, put them all in a soundproof glass room. Guess who doesnt have to lose time to the audience or bitching at the audience repeatedly because of it. The fucking network could probably make it a win too by just also taping the audience reactions and having people go back to see audience reactions.",warren,"The debates are not even debates.

We're still 220 days until the first primary votes are cast, and 494 days until we fight head-on against Donald Trump. Senator Warren is using her time wisely in building a ground game in Iowa, plans to support her future Presidency, and listening to what voters need every single day.

Question regarding Healthcare,"Hey all! I thought Liz did great at the debate last night!

I didn't think much about it at the time, but my mom sent me a [politico article](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/27/elizabeth-warren-debate-landmine-227241) today that describes a potential 'landmine' for Warren that Delaney brought up during the debate.

Basically the article suggests that any Republican operatives studying last night's debate would hear Delaney's point about **how every hospital admin he approached claimed they'd go broke if they paid Medicare rates for every procedure.**

I did a quick google and found [this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/health/medicare-for-all-hospitals.html) that gives more detail on the issue. Having felt the Bern last campaign cycle, I am aware that every media outlet has blind spots for certain candidates/policies, so I figured I'd double check with people more informed on Warren and/or the universal healthcare concept.

I'm betting this talking point has been brought up enough that Liz has a plan for that, or maybe the article and I have mistaken Warren's claim on the issue.

Who in the top 5 should be hope Warren runs against in the primary?,"I think it's clear that Warren's draining out Buttigeg. Here are my thoughts on the others:

	Sanders: Sanders probably pulls more lay people due to his (overly) simplistic messaging

	Biden: Biden has a bigger base but that plays less a factor if it goes 1v1

	Harris: Harris gets the black vote. This one is fairly even, maybe Warren slightly

	Buttigeg: Warren has more cred and seems to be taking from him already

I think Warren would do well against Biden but not against Bernard. Against Harris I'm not sure (I don't fully understand Harris's appeal)",warren,"Who in the top 5 should be hope Warren runs against in the primary?

**Some housekeeping**

It was brought to our attention that there’s some concern we use bitly links, which requires a level of trust that we’re directing you to a legitimate link. 

That’s a totally fair point. Our hope is that as moderators we will earn the trust that we’re not trying to scam anyone here. 

To be completely transparent, we’re using bitly links to collect anonymized data so this sub can be as effective as possible in helping the Warren campaign. (e.g., what time are most people clicking links, how many people click but don’t donate, where in a post is the most effective place to put a link). For example, above we’re using bitly links, because we want to know if people read the plans, find debate parties, and donate from these posts.

But this is your community as much as it is ours, so we’re open to feedback. We hope to earn your trust—and that you’ll see our only intentions are to help make this sub an effective organizing tool for future President Warren. 👸

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, if there's anything you'd like to share anything that doesn't necessarily warrant a full post or is off topic (e.g., funny Twitter posts or memes related to Warren, discussion on issues that don't directly relate to Warren or her proposals, etc.), post it here. As always, follow the rules on the sidebar (especially regarding Personal Attacks, Dividing Democrats, and Civility).

Thanks to everyone who donated for Warren's 70th birthday this weekend! We've now raised over $1,100 for her campaign from 76 people. Not too shabby.

**Some housekeeping**

It was brought to our attention that there’s some concern we use bitly links, which requires a level of trust that we’re directing you to a legitimate link. 

That’s a totally fair point. Our hope is that as moderators we will earn the trust that we’re not trying to scam anyone here. 

To be completely transparent, we’re using bitly links to collect anonymized data so this sub can be as effective as possible in helping the Warren campaign. (e.g., what time are most people clicking links, how many people click but don’t donate, where in a post is the most effective place to put a link). For example, above we’re using bitly links, because we want to know if people read the plans, find debate parties, and donate from these posts.

But this is your community as much as it is ours, so we’re open to feedback. We hope to earn your trust—and that you’ll see our only intentions are to help make this sub an effective organizing tool for future President Warren. 👸

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, if there's anything you'd like to share anything that doesn't necessarily warrant a full post or is off topic (e.g., funny Twitter posts or memes related to Warren, discussion on issues that don't directly relate to Warren or her proposals, etc.), post it here. As always, follow the rules on the sidebar (especially regarding Personal Attacks, Dividing Democrats, and Civility).

Thanks for participating and hope to see you here for the debate!"

"A tool for combating people who say Warren isn't a ""progressive""","Hello all!

I've noticed an uptick of people (or trolls) in certain subs who like to say that Warren isn't a true progressive, is war hawkish, doesn't vote for the middle class as much as Bernie, and other stuff along these lines.  I have found [this website](http://politicsthatwork.com/voting-record/Elizabeth-Warren-412542) an excellent tool for combating these kinds of posts with actual facts.  It shows her voting record on a multitude of issues and you can also search for other people running to compare if need be. 

We will only see more of this as Warren rises in the polls and it is intentionally meant to cause discord among Democratic voters.  There's not much we can do to stop it, but we can combat it with irrefutable facts and sources.  And remember: vote with your heart in the primary, vote democrat in the general.  Otherwise we get four more years of Trump (and even Biden is preferable to that).

Common Elizabeth Warren attacks and responses to them,"Inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/c1j774/weekly_update_and_discussion_thread_617_to_623/erel69v?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), I thought it'd be a good idea to outline responses to some bad faith Warren attacks.

**Charge:** Elizabeth Warren won't ignite a political revolution because she doesn't engage the grassroots.

&gt;A political revolution built around one central figure is not a sustainable revolution. In order to truly engage the grassroots and make lasting change, Sen. Warren has decentralized. Since her election to Senate in 2012, Warren has been [inspiring a new generation of grassroots organizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jEVXR7sMlI). Reaching out to groups like [Indivisble](https://www.facebook.com/indivisibleguide/videos/live-now-join-indivisible-co-executive-director-ezra-levin-in-conversation-with-/322565641540645/) and [Sister Cities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdQFyJkFyc) to build out a grassroots coalition and to ensure that the energy that sends a Democrat to the White House has staying power to elect a progressive congress.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren knows you don't have to reinvent the wheel: there are already hundreds of grassroots organizations focused on a wide variety of individual issues - a latent political revolution. Elizabeth's strength is uniting diverse groups of stakeholders around a key set of issues. [This is the same grassroots strategy she used in 2009 before even being elected to Congress, to create a whole new federal agency](https://youtu.be/7JqLHGB3pJE?t=747) (the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/), which has returned over $12 billion dollars to consumers) at a time when Republican candidates for President were [debating (and forgetting) which part of the government to eliminate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN8uFJz9gTk).  
&gt;  
&gt;This strategy emulates the very successful model of the original Progressive movement that passed the New Deal, which was marked by a shifting coalition of groups that had various and at times conflicting interests (not by imposing ideological purity tests).  
&gt;  
&gt;Warren has sworn off super PACs and high-dollar fundraisers, so she's relying on you to get in this fight.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charge:** Elizabeth Warren has no foreign policy.

&gt;Elizabeth Warren outlined her comprehensive foreign policy vision in a [2018 address to American University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzRHeCrU3r8). Her three main points were:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Making Globalization Work:** U.S. foreign policy should not prioritize corporate profits over American families. To make sure that globalization benefits middle-class Americans, trade negotiations should be used to curtail the power of multinational monopolies and crack down on tax havens. Workers should be meaningfully represented at the negotiating table, and the resulting agreements should be used to raise and enforce labor standards.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ending Endless Wars:** It is the job of the U.S. government to do what is necessary to protect Americans, but it is long past time to start asking what truly makes the country safer—and what does not. Military efforts alone will never fully succeed at ending terrorism, because it is not possible to fight one’s way out of extremism. \[...\] Defense spending should be set at sustainable levels, and the money saved should be used to fund other forms of international engagement and critical domestic programs.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Foreign Policy Starts at Home:** With American power increasingly challenged from within and without, we can no longer afford to think of our domestic agenda as separate from our foreign policy. A stronger economy, a healthier democracy, and a united people—these are the engines that power the nation and will project American strength and values throughout the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can read her full address here: [A Foreign Policy for All](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all)

&amp;#x200B;

**Charge:** Elizabeth Warren won't fight to unravel the military-industrial complex.

&gt;While many candidates talk about ending the military-industrial complex, Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate to date to present a plan to do so. Her proposal to [Shut the Revolving Door Between Defense Contractors and the Pentagon](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/its-time-to-reduce-corporate-influence-at-the-pentagon-98f52ee0fcf1) would decrease the influence giant contractors have over government and allow us to begin making cuts to our bloated military budget.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charge:** Elizabeth Warren will take PAC money in the general election.

&gt;No 2020 candidate has sworn off PAC money in the general election.  
&gt;  
&gt;And for good reason: the Trump campaign has already raised [almost $100 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/trump-fundraising-2020.html) for the general election fight. If we're going to beat the well funded Republican machine, it's going to take everything we've got.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren is one of only two candidates to be [relying on grassroots donors to fund her primary campaign](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/the-best-president-money-cant-buy-1adfbe01a344), but she has been transparent in saying that she does not believe in ""unilateral disarmament"" for the general election.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charge:** Elizabeth Warren doesn't support Medicare-for-All.

&gt;Elizabeth Warren is a strong supporter of Medicare-for-All and has [co-sponsored Bernie's Medicare-for-All Act](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-joins-sanders-13-other-senators-to-reintroduce-medicare-for-all) in the Senate. It is featured on her campaign website under the ""Rebuilding the Middle Class"" section with her [Ultra-Millionaire Tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/) (a 2% tax on accumulated wealth greater than $50 million) as a suggested funding mechanism.  
&gt;  
&gt;She made her support for M4A unequivocally clear in a [recent survey conducted by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/politics/2020-democrats-health-care.html):  
&gt;  
&gt;**NYT: Do you support a “Medicare for all” system — similar to the bill sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders — that would eliminate private health insurance, including employer-provided coverage, and be paid for by taxes**  
&gt;  
&gt;EW: Yes. **I support Medicare-for-All** so that everyone is covered, no one goes broke because of a medical bill, and we start treating health care like the basic human right that it is.  
&gt;  
&gt;**NYT:** **Do you support Americans having the choice between a “public option” health care plan run by the government, and private health insurance?**  
&gt;  
&gt;EW: Every proposal on the table right now would layer coverage expansions that add up over time, but **there’s no excuse for stopping at half-measures**. The aim has to be very clear: make sure every single person in this country has guaranteed health care coverage.  
&gt;  
&gt;**NYT: Would you favor only modifications to the Affordable Care Act, including extending premium assistance to more middle-class Americans?**  
&gt;  
&gt;EW: I have a bill to crack down on shady behavior by insurance companies and improve the quality and affordability of health insurance purchased on the A.C.A. exchanges or provided through employer coverage. **We have to protect the A.C.A., but we can’t stop there.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**NYT: Which of the options \[M4A, public option, ACA 2.0\] do you believe would be the best way to improve the health care system?**  
&gt;  
&gt;EW: Medicare for all. Our aim should be to cover the most people at the lowest cost, and for me **that means Medicare for All**. Health care is a basic human right and no one should go broke to pay a medical bill.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charge:** Elizabeth Warren just copied all of Bernie's plans.

&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [end lobbying as we know it](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018.08.21%20Anti%20Corruption%20Act%20One-Pager.pdf). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to allow [workers to elect 40% of a company's board of directors (co-determination)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Accountable%20Capitalism%20Act%20One-Pager.pdf). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [tax wealth](https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [tax the real corporate profits of companies](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-proposing-a-big-new-idea-the-real-corporate-profits-tax-29dde7c960d). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [break up big tech monopolies](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [end the military industrial complex](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/its-time-to-reduce-corporate-influence-at-the-pentagon-98f52ee0fcf1). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [treat the the opioid crisis](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-comprehensive-plan-to-end-the-opioid-crisis-9d85deaa3ccb). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [bring back American manufacturing with industrial policy](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/a-plan-for-economic-patriotism-13b879f4cfc7). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [fight against exclusionary zoning and the wrongs of racial redlining](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-housing-plan-for-america-20038e19dc26). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [close the racial disparity in maternal deaths](https://www.essence.com/feature/sen-elizabeth-warren-black-women-mortality-essence/). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [level the playing field for entrepreneurs of color](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/leveling-the-playing-field-for-entrepreneurs-2a585aa2b6d7). Bernie does not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elizabeth Warren has a plan to [improve military housing](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-to-improve-our-military-housing-b1a46ba235b8). Bernie does not.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charge**: Elizabeth Warren isn't electable.

&gt;In 2008, nobody thought that Obama was electable. Until he was. In 2016, nobody thought Trump was electable. Until he was. The truth is, in any given election, there is no way to forecast who is electable and who isn't. What we can do is look at past successes, and Warren's history shows that she has a fighting chance.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2012, when Warren was first running for office, people said the same thing. She was going up against Scott Brown, a popular Republican incumbent who had just beaten a qualified and well-respected female candidate two years prior. Elizabeth was told she couldn't win: Massachusetts wasn't ready to elect a woman to the Senate. Nevertheless, she persisted. She started that race down 20 points and ended up winning by 7.5, becoming MA's first female senator.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, Elizabeth is the only major Democratic candidate who has actually beaten an incumbent Republican in the past 10 years. She's done it before, she can do it again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charge**: Elizabeth Warren's policies are too extreme.

&gt;Actually, Elizabeth Warren's policies are very popular. Take for example her [Ultra-Millionaire Tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/): [61% of all voters (even 50% of Republicans!) support it](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/4/18210370/warren-wealth-tax-poll). In fact, when polled individually progressive economic policies like expanding social security, raising the minimum wage and regulating big banks [have about 60%-70% support](https://www.dataforprogress.org/polling-the-left-agenda). As Elizabeth Warren likes to say, [the progressive agenda is America's agenda](https://youtu.be/-WAUB1Q-b7I?t=1711).  
&gt;  
&gt;The largest obstacle standing in the way of enacting these progressive policies is money. When you have a government that's rigged for the wealthy and the well connected, popular economic policies become harder and harder to enact. That's why Elizabeth has said [her number one legislative priority upon assuming office](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18652215/elizabeth-warren-interview-2020-democratic-primary-policies) would be her [Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018.08.21%20Anti%20Corruption%20Act%20One-Pager.pdf) which would end lobbying as we know it.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we're going to pass anti-corruption laws, it's going take a grassroots movement to pressure elected officials. That's why Elizabeth has sworn off corporate money and high-dollar fundraisers, relying on people like you to power her campaign.

**Charge**: Elizabeth Warren isn't electable.

&gt;In 2008, nobody thought that Obama was electable. Until he was. In 2016, nobody thought Trump was electable. Until he was. The truth is, in any given election, there is no way to forecast who is electable and who isn't. What we can do is look at past successes, and Warren's history shows that she has a fighting chance.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2012, when Warren was first running for office, people said the same thing. She was going up against Scott Brown, a popular Republican incumbent who had just beaten a qualified and well-respected female candidate two years prior. Elizabeth was told she couldn't win: Massachusetts wasn't ready to elect a woman to the Senate. Nevertheless, she persisted. She started that race down 20 points and ended up winning by 7.5, becoming MA's first female senator.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, Elizabeth is the only major Democratic candidate who has actually beaten an incumbent Republican in the past 10 years. She's done it before, she can do it again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charge**: Elizabeth Warren's policies are too extreme.

&gt;Actually, Elizabeth Warren's policies are very popular. Take for example her [Ultra-Millionaire Tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/): [61% of all voters (even 50% of Republicans!) support it](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/4/18210370/warren-wealth-tax-poll). In fact, when polled individually progressive economic policies like expanding social security, raising the minimum wage and regulating big banks [have about 60%-70% support](https://www.dataforprogress.org/polling-the-left-agenda). As Elizabeth Warren likes to say, [the progressive agenda is America's agenda](https://youtu.be/-WAUB1Q-b7I?t=1711).  
&gt;  
&gt;The largest obstacle standing in the way of enacting these progressive policies is money. When you have a government that's rigged for the wealthy and the well connected, popular economic policies become harder and harder to enact. That's why Elizabeth has said [her number one legislative priority upon assuming office](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18652215/elizabeth-warren-interview-2020-democratic-primary-policies) would be her [Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018.08.21%20Anti%20Corruption%20Act%20One-Pager.pdf) which would end lobbying as we know it.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we're going to pass anti-corruption laws, it's going take a grassroots movement to pressure elected officials. That's why Elizabeth has sworn off corporate money and high-dollar fundraisers, relying on people like you to power her campaign. Sign up for the [All in for Warren community](https://community.elizabethwarren.com/) and [make a donation](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/redditforwarren) to become a part of this grassroots movement"

Wondering if y'all could help me out.,"*This got longer than I meant, feel free to skip the block paragraphs of context to the questions if you want*

Hey to all you fine people!

Long story short, I've narrowed my support in these primaries down to voting against biden as #1 (I'm in Georgia, so it'll likely be a two-way race by the time I can actually vote), Pete Buttigieg as #2, and Elizabeth as my #3. 

The two are very close in my mind, but thus far Pete has won my support with a combination of the facts that, in my mind, he has the most raw intellect (though I would place Warren, Kamala, and Yang right below him) and openness to learning in the field, he is the best communicator in the field (something I consider of actual value to a president, not just fluff), and his focus on the future (namely his structural reforms). On the other hand, because I have largely social democratic positions, he is to the right of me on many issues, and while he has started to address this with his issues page and some plan roll-outs, I am sucker for detailed ideas for problems. 

Which brings me to Warren. She is, by and large, far closer to my positions, and appeals strongly to my desire for someone with concrete ideas,  but I have a few problems that are severely holding back my ability to support her. Namely, I have serious doubts as to her skills and decision-making when it comes to communicating and messaging. I also have worries on some of her policies.

More specifically diving into the former: While I freely admit that I have not watched/listened to an overly significant amount of Warren speaking, what I have seen has been relatively uninspiring to me. Or, to be clearer, her speaking gets *me* inspired and ready to fight, but it feels as if that is only because I already fundamentally agree with her and feel passionate about the same issues. In contrast, when I listen to someone like Pete, I get flashbacks to speakers such as Obama, or Reagan, who could truly inspire even those who disagree with them strongly. Additionally, her decisions to respond in the manner she did to the ""pocahontas"" debacle, and that awkward af video of ""casually"" having a beer in her kitchen *scream* of similar communication issues as Hillary had that I firmly believe cost her the election (along with the bs reopening of the email investigation). Now, I'm sure you completely disagree with all of this characterization/take, but I'll get back to that in a second!

Secondly, some of her policy positions really provide barriers in getting behind her as someone who bases policy on evidence. These are, in order of seriousness: trade, nuclear power, and gmos. While she appears to understand that free trade is in fact mutually beneficial on a macro scale, she seems (to my knowledge) to support limiting it because the impacts of it are varied and hurt some populations and benefit others. This is both counterproductive and ineffectual. I'm not trying to rehash the whole free trade debate, because I'm sure many of y'all disagree vehemently with me, but it's there. Second, and getting to the one's that truly make me worry about her reliance on evidence, Nuclear power. I have been completely unable to find any mention of nuclear power in any of her policies. This suggests that she is either personally against it, or unwilling to express her consideration of one of the most viable paths to saving the environment. Look, I get that there are arguments against relying solely on Nuclear Power indefinitely, but any policy that doesn't plan to use it at least transitionally owes an explanation of why. Finally, GMOs: Monsanto is basically the embodiment of evil corporations, so I get the urge to knock them down a peg, but stepping out to try to enforce GMO labeling is simply gross. GMO's are a necessity in a world projected to hit 9 billion people, are no less healthy than normal crops, and labeling it like a health concern simply drives scientific illiteracy and will likely result in more people dying than otherwise would, rather than the other way around. If Warren wishes to regulate Monsanto and promote safety when it comes to potential future problems with careless experimenting, then she should pass smart legislation to do exactly that, rather than contribute to a baseless public panic on the issue. 

But to get to the real point of my post, I have 4 questions for y'all:

1) What are your favorite speeches/examples of good communications from Warren? 

2) I have hear some parts of this, but what is Warren's side of the story when it comes to the native american fiasco? Or in other words, why should I not be worried that it (and the beer video) points to a fundamental misunderstanding of how to engage with Trump and the American public?

3) I'd like to think I've done my due diligence, but it's very possible I've missed a shift in policy or a statement on one of the issues I've mentioned concern over. Is there any material I should look at which indicated more agreement with my stance on those three issues?

4) If there's not, then I guess... what would you personally say to assuage my concerns about those positions? 


Just to be clear, while relative comparison on specific categories is fine, please try to avoid getting me to support Warren by dragging all the other candidates. I'd really like to get to a point where I'm excited about Warren, not voting for the least bad option. 

If anyone has bothered to read this all the way through and responds, then thank you for your help in advance haha!",warren,"Wondering if y'all could help me out. *This got longer than I meant, feel free to skip the block paragraphs of context to the questions if you want*

"What to do when the conspiracy theories and sexist attacks start against Warren and your support for Warren, here's what to do","Ok first off, politico is a terrible news outlet who's main theme for the past decade has been ""Democrats in disarray"".  They look to stir up division.  


They just printed this:

[Centrists are coming around to Elizabeth Warren as an alternative to Bernie Sanders](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/democratic-establishment-elizabeth-warren-1369874)

They base the article on one comment from one guy from one irrelevant think tank, that has absolutely no power within the Democratic party, and most people just ignore them


&gt;“One is a Democratic capitalist narrative,” said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist think tank that convened a conference of party insiders in South Carolina this week designed to warn about the risks of a nominee whose views are out of the political mainstream. “The other is a socialist narrative.”


Next line

&gt;Third Way, which isn’t backing a candidate...

Second off, Bernie Sanders has used this incredibly ridiculous article to attack Warren with baseless conspiracies. 


[The cat is out of the bag. The corporate wing of the Democratic Party is publicly ""anybody but Bernie.""

As you know Warren is for all of these things.  What Bernie is doing here is signalling to the conspiracy theory that's popped up online that Warren is just running as a spoiler to Bernie (because it's His Turn™)

 For those of you who weren't Hillary supporters in 2016 here's what you can expect now:


The more ""impassioned"" Bernie supporters will attack you and degrade you for daring to like a woman with amazing policy.  Things you should expect to be called are: vagina voter, corporate whore, neoliberal, you're supporting the status quo, and they'll use every single ""progressive"" buzzword to attack you personally. You will face sexist abuse, and you can bet your ass Republicans and Russians, LARPing as Bernie supporters, will be joining in to attack you, making the division within the party seem worse than it is. 

They are bullies, and they best way to counteract that is to call out their toxicity and DO NOT HIDE YOUR SUPPORT FOR WARREN FROM THEM, because you'll be hiding it from the world. No Private Facebook groups, get out and support your candidate unabashedly. Be visible online, wear her t-shirts, slap her bumper sticker on your car, talk about her in public, go to her rallies.

Warren on Israel-Palestine?,"Can someone clarify her position on this? I recall Warren speaking about the conflict at one point, and (uncharacteristically) repeating the conventional wisdom, without referencing the history of ethnic cleansing (still going on in terms of government-sanctioned settlements) that made Israel possible.

I will make no bones about being anti-Israel (I am certainly not against the Jewish presence in or immigration to the region, but I am against Israel/""the Jewish state"" think the Jews and the Arabs should live in a secular, multiethnic state, modeled on post-civil war Lebanon.).

How the Native American Blunder Could Help Warren in a General Election,"Let me preface by saying that although I support Warren (because I think she is much more intellectually serious than the only other candidate, Bernie, with whom I'm aligned ideologically, and because contrary to the media narrative I believe she is quite charismatic and likeable), I think the Native American  claim was a significant mistake. I don't believe she deliberately lied--media reports indicate that her extended family, including distant cousins she never met, heard and believed the Native American lore--but I do believe she was opportunistic in claiming it, since even if she had been 1/8 Native American or whatever she was culturally, physically, and socially white.

We all game systems to our advantage. But Warren made a mistake insofar as she didn't think about the moral implications of gaming this particular system, designed for victims of historical injustice. The gravity of her mistake is significantly mitigated by the fact that (while I think she most likely checked the box in order to get an edge) she received no benefit from it.

So I've addressed the moral issue (which I believe is a significant mistake, though by no means disqualifying). As to the politics I think this will actually end up helping Warren in a general election. Why? Because it will provoke Trump into buffoonish overreach, e.g. berating her constantly as Pocahontas or Rachel Dolezal in nationally televised debates, that will dramatically overshadow her mistake.",warren,"How the Native American Blunder Could Help Warren in a General Election Let me preface by saying that although I support Warren (because I think she is much more intellectually serious than the only other candidate, Bernie, with whom I'm aligned ideologically, and because contrary to the media narrative I believe she is quite charismatic and likeable), I think the Native American  claim was a significant mistake.

The secret genius of Warren's selfie lines,"It actually serves as a stealth marketing tactic. Almost all of those people she takes a pic with are going to put it up on their social media, and all their friends/followers are going to see it. It's one thing to see a paid ad in your facebook feed with a candidate asking to donate 5 dollars, but seeing a pic of that candidate hanging out with your friend not only comes across as more genuine than a paid ad, but it also (probably) endears them to you just a little more. In a kind of ""Any friend of Sarah's is a friend of mine!"" way. 

Its basically 30,000 lawn signs or facebook ads, and the campaigned paid for it all with nothing but a little extra time.",warren,"The secret genius of Warren's selfie lines It actually serves as a stealth marketing tactic.

The Buttigieg Paradox: How does a congeniality candidate rise in the midst of a policy flood?,"Per [RCP today](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) and general media commentary, Warren's both taking her moment in the spotlight and pushing up the waterline of policy requirements in order to be viable. On the other hand Pete Buttigieg has been so lax as to be accused of outright laziness when it comes to promoting specific policy. So, why is Buttigieg rising despite the fact he doesn't fit the mold of policy pusher? 

&amp;#x200B;

One statement that can be quickly made is that he's taking advantage of falling frontrunners. Just as Warren's siphoning votes from Biden and Sanders, Buttigieg is also picking up straying members as well. On top of this, he's the natural contrast to Warren. For those who drop support for moderate candidates like Biden, Buttigieg is a stand-in over more controversial figures like Sanders. And, finally, I'd guess that he's simply just moving his brand the same way Warren started earlier, building a base outside the normally visible channels. 

&amp;#x200B;

But those are my suppositions...what about yours?

Financing Warren's policy plans,"I love Elizabeth Warren's policy ideas; any one of them would give a huge benefit to the people that politicians *should* care about most. Not only that, but they are actual concrete proposals, rather than just ideas or ideals. 

However, there's one thing that I'm curious about. I notice that for each of these policies the financing will come either from corporations or from the highest earners (top 1%). So does this mean that her policy ideas are 'mutually exclusive'? Is there enough money to be taken from these two sources to finance all of them?

Reflections on 2015/16,"Many of you may recall that the main politics subreddit became very hostile to HRC during the 2016 primary.  While I wasn’t motivated to counter that trend back then, this time I’m feeling a bit different.  The reason is if the primary politics subreddit turns into a channel for tearing down one particular candidate, that message reaches a wide audience, and right or wrong, many people will succumb to the drumbeat of the negative stories.

While I’m not going to point fingers, it is the case that certain groups coordinate their activities in an effort to shape the narrative on reddit.  While I’m not calling for similar coordination, I do make a habit of checking the new, rising and controversial queue of the politics subreddit to see if Warren could use my support there.",warren,"Reflections on 2015/16 Many of you may recall that the main politics subreddit became very hostile to HRC during the 2016 primary.

Campaign Music Discussion,"Watching Warren's speech at the California convention, I noticed she chose to come out to Dolly Parton's [9 to5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbxUSsFXYo4).  I had given thought before as to what songs would make an appearance, or which would make sense to me.  The first two to come to mind were No Doubt's [Just A Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHzOOQfhPFg) and 4 Non-Blondes [What's Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXnxTNIWkc).  I think all three speak well toward the ""2nd wave"" of women getting involved in politics, and an appeal to 80s/90s nostalgia might help attract Millennials like myself.  They also provide a range of tone - No Doubt's frenetic energy vs. 4 Non-Blondes relatively more soothing sound.  A fourth that popped into my mind, but was quickly rejected was Rage Against the Machine's Bulls on Parade.  Their music may be as relevant as ever, but it's hardly something to connect to a political campaign.  Plus they'd most likely refuse to let you use their music no matter how progressive your platform is.

Anybody else attend a Warren campaign stop or meet-and-greet?,"I traveled from Chicago to Ottumwa, Iowa this past weekend to sit in on a Warren town hall meet-and-greet event, and I was blown away by how intimate the entire event was, from check-in through the selfie line.

I got there early and posted up at the town's lone bar until about a half-hour before doors opened. Several volunteers were present to check in guests and talk about what to expect. A number of Warren supporters and those on the fence about her showed up early, hoping to get a good view of the senator. I was maybe fourth in line and got a spot right beside one of the Democratic chairs and her husband.

Having seen other events for Ms. Warren, I think I chose a good one, because this was done ""thrust style,"" where the room's chairs were all set up in a circle, allowing room in the center for the speakers. At certain points of the speech I was a foot and a half from her, and I couldn't help but look on in awe. I'm sure there are Facebook streams out there of me staring like a buffoon.

She spoke for about 30-35 minutes and then took questions from the audience, including her 400th question. Doing the math, taking into account she does maybe 3-5 questions per stop, this would be her 40th stop or so already since announcing, and that's pretty impressive. I thought her answers to the questions were good and detailed, but very dense and I can see her perhaps needing to simplify it for the simpler folks somewhere down the road.

After the speech and the questions, she lined up for photos with everybody who wanted one. She also signed campaign signs, copies of her book, and my copy of TIME Magazine. Just a very intimate, stress-free 90 minutes, and well worth the 5+ hour one-way drive. Getting to tell Ms. Warren I work in education and have worked with special needs students was a highlight.

I was maybe fourth in line and got a spot right beside one of the Democratic chairs and her husband.

Having seen other events for Ms. Warren, I think I chose a good one, because this was done ""thrust style,"" where the room's chairs were all set up in a circle, allowing room in the center for the speakers. At certain points of the speech I was a foot and a half from her, and I couldn't help but look on in awe. I'm sure there are Facebook streams out there of me staring like a buffoon.

She spoke for about 30-35 minutes and then took questions from the audience, including her 400th question. Doing the math, taking into account she does maybe 3-5 questions per stop, this would be her 40th stop or so already since announcing, and that's pretty impressive. I thought her answers to the questions were good and detailed, but very dense and I can see her perhaps needing to simplify it for the simpler folks somewhere down the road.

After the speech and the questions, she lined up for photos with everybody who wanted one. She also signed campaign signs, copies of her book, and my copy of TIME Magazine. Just a very intimate, stress-free 90 minutes, and well worth the 5+ hour one-way drive. Getting to tell Ms. Warren I work in education and have worked with special needs students was a highlight.

Wealth Tax vs Value-Added Tax,"According to [Warren's website](https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/), she proposes implementing a wealth tax at the following levels:

* No additional tax on the first $50 million of net worth.
* 2% annually on net worth between $50 million and $1 billion.
* 3% annually on net worth above $1 billion.

Here is the specific example she uses to illustrate the problem her tax would solve:

&gt;Consider two people: an heir with $500 million in yachts, jewelry, and fine art, and a teacher with no savings in the bank. If both the heir and the teacher bring home $50,000 in labor income next year, they would pay the same amount in federal taxes, despite their vastly different circumstances. Increasing income taxes won’t address this problem. 

We should reward what we want more of and punish what we want less of. And her example seems to be targeting *conspicuous consumption,* which I wholeheartedly agree with. However, her wealth tax also disincentivizes capital investment, since stock market holdings are included in net worth calculations. That has both pros and cons, since there are both good and bad kinds of investment.

So why not target the conspicuous consumption problem directly through implementing a value-added tax (VAT) on luxury goods? After all, the [vast majority](https://taxfoundation.org/vat-rates-europe-2019/) of developed countries already have one, so it's a clearly viable option.",warren,"Wealth Tax vs Value-Added Tax According to [Warren's website](https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/), she proposes implementing a wealth tax at the following levels:

Why is Warren your Primary Pick?,"Here's my answer:

Warren is becoming known for her plans. But, that isn't her best quality in my opinion. It doesn't make her uniquely qualified to be president because plans can easily be shared and adopted by others. 

 What makes her *my* primary choice are her priorities. She understands that we have a huge quantity of critical issues to address, and places corrupt influence at the top of the list.

If we fail to address corruption first, it will taint every legislative attempt. However, if we do make strides in addressing corruption, major initiatives become easier to tackle.

"I thought Warren had fairly clear pro nuclear energy stances, was I wrong?","I remember seeing something that indicated she was at least open to building more nuclear reactors to reduce carbon emissions, as opposed to merely keeping those we have open, or worse yet trying to shut them down, but I'm not finding it as I currently Google.   
I know Booker has made the most full throated endorsement of nuclear power, and Buttigieg has made a somewhat more tentative statement about prioritizing emissions reduction, and that nuclear has to be part of that. I know that Sanders has taken a fairly firm anti nuclear stance, and it's a big part of why I probably won't support him. If Warren hasn't demonstrated at least openness to more nuclear it might lose her my vote, because I don't really believe we can face Climate Change with the intensity needed without using nuclear energy. I wish one of the top 5 (those mentioned plus Biden and Harris) would take a vocally pro nuclear stance and really respond to concerns from the left, and make the case that we need this to be on the table, but so far I've not seen that.   
  
Warren, to me, is the best candidate to do so. She's made detailed and evidence based policy her brand, she has fairly strong leftist cred (pro nuclear is a more bipartisan/centrist position) and she would, to my mind at least, benefit from creating a clear distinction between herself and Sanders, particularly one that convinces some moderates that she's not so scary. I think she could link it with her business critique as well, saying that privately owned nuclear (as the US has mostly done) has failed, but (mostly) publicly owned nuclear power has delivered safe, low cost, low carbon energy in France, Sweden, and South Korea for decades.   
  
If America could become a major player in nuclear reactor design and production it could benefit us both economically, and environmentally, as well as pushing the whole world towards faster decarbonization. If we did it right it could also speed up electrification by lowering electricity prices, which would also serve to keep prices down for many if the goods low income people spend their money on. In general Nuclear power is full of good potential and the downsides are either overblown or eminently solvable, and I wish there was more conversation about this as part of the existential threat of climate change.",warren,"I thought Warren had fairly clear pro nuclear energy stances, was I wrong?

Who would your ideal VP picks be?,"Over the last couple of weeks, I've been trying to make a conscious effort to learn more about the other candidates (watching interviews, town halls, reading website policies, discussing with supporters that I know) , and this really changed my impressions of a lot of them. It got me thinking on who would make a good VP pick for Warren.

Here are my top 3 at the moment -

Buttigieg - I was hugely impressed by his town hall on Fox, especially his response to a question on late term abortion.  I don't see Warren/Buttigieg losing any state that Hillary won (though they may perform worse in states she lost like Georgia, Texas). I can also see them doing really well in the Midwest and rust belt - winning 2 of Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania will will the presidency.


Stacy Abrams - I'm biased as someone who volunteered and voted for her in the governor's race. She's an excellent communicator, and very relatable. Again, shouldn't lose anything Hillary won. Could perhaps win Georgia and Florida.


Beto - If Texas turns blue, we win. It's that simple.

A New Iowa Poll Looks Really Good for Warren,"[So a new Iowa poll came out today](https://iowastartingline.com/2019/05/20/starting-line-change-research-poll-biden-sanders-locked-in-iowa-tie/) and while it has Bernie and Biden ties at the top at 24% each, it also has Warren in 4th at 12%. 538 has this rated as a grade “C” poll, so take that for what it’s worth, but the underlying numbers are really positive for Warren. I’m going to just copy/paste from the poll itself below:

**Elizabeth Warren’s Underlying Strength**

If you read the rest of the poll before looking at the horserace numbers, you might think that Warren would come in first or second. She scores top marks among Democratic caucus-goers on a number of fronts. Warren gets a 40% “very favorable” rating, higher than anyone else. Combining her “very favorable” and “somewhat favorable” numbers puts her at 78% favorable, a significant jump ahead of Sanders’ next-closest 71%.

“Good news for Elizabeth Warren: her favorability exceeds that of any other candidate in the race and her name recognition is near universal,” Loria observed “... When we ask respondents to identify the five candidates they’re most excited about, 54% say Warren, followed by Biden (53%), then Harris (53%), Sanders (49%), and Buttigieg (46%).”

Warren also leads the rest of the Democrats in three other poll questions, when asked which candidates caucus-goers describe as “smart,” as “tough,” and as “honest and ethical.”

And Warren’s support is not dependent on one slice of the electorate. Her favorability numbers stay relatively even among age groups – 36% of 18-34, 38% of 35-49, 41% of 50-64, and 43% of 65+ of those polled said they view her very favorably. Compare that to Sanders, where 63% of the 18-34 age group rates him very favorably, while only 28% of the 65+ age group does so. Biden has the opposite issue, where 47% of the 65+ group has him as very favorable, when just 20% of the 18-34 age group feels that way.

Both women and men equally list Warren as one of the candidates they’re excited about (54% each). The same is true of different education levels, and even whether someone caucused for Sanders or Clinton in 2016. That could point to Warren being a unifying force in the Democratic primary; were she to win, it doesn’t look like one group of Democrats would feel particularly left out.

Where she runs into issues may be a controversial subject. When asked which candidates they view as “likable,” Warren falls down into sixth place at 40%, behind Biden at 67%, Buttigieg at 56%, Sanders at 45%, O’Rourke at 43%, and Harris at 41%. Warren also slips to fourth place when asked which of the candidates are most likely to defeat Trump in the general election. Biden, Sanders, and Harris lead her there. Those are the only areas in the poll where Warren struggles.

Interestingly, Warren still receives the highest favorability and excitement numbers despite this. It seems that perhaps Democratic caucus-goers themselves really like Warren, but they’re worried that other voters may not.

**Edit:**

Per u/Vaisbeau in the comments:

“With viability rules in the Iowa Caucus (in most precincts, a candidate needs to get to 15% to be viable and receive delegates), Iowans’ second-choices are important. Again on this front, Warren does well. She is the top second-choice candidate at 19%. The top five are:

•	⁠Warren: 19%
•	⁠Biden: 16%
•	⁠Harris: 15%
•	⁠Sanders: 14%
•	⁠Buttigieg: 11%”",warren,"A New Iowa Poll Looks Really Good for Warren [So a new Iowa poll came out today](https://iowastartingline.com/2019/05/20/starting-line-change-research-poll-biden-sanders-locked-in-iowa-tie/) and while it has Bernie and Biden ties at the top at 24% each, it also has Warren in 4th at 12%. 538 has this rated as a grade “C” poll, so take that for what it’s worth, but the underlying numbers are really positive for Warren. I’m going to just copy/paste from the poll itself below:

**Elizabeth Warren’s Underlying Strength**

If you read the rest of the poll before looking at the horserace numbers, you might think that Warren would come in first or second. She scores top marks among Democratic caucus-goers on a number of fronts. Warren gets a 40% “very favorable” rating, higher than anyone else. Combining her “very favorable” and “somewhat favorable” numbers puts her at 78% favorable, a significant jump ahead of Sanders’ next-closest 71%.

“Good news for Elizabeth Warren: her favorability exceeds that of any other candidate in the race and her name recognition is near universal,” Loria observed “... When we ask respondents to identify the five candidates they’re most excited about, 54% say Warren, followed by Biden (53%), then Harris (53%), Sanders (49%), and Buttigieg (46%).”

Warren also leads the rest of the Democrats in three other poll questions, when asked which candidates caucus-goers describe as “smart,” as “tough,” and as “honest and ethical.”

And Warren’s support is not dependent on one slice of the electorate. Her favorability numbers stay relatively even among age groups – 36% of 18-34, 38% of 35-49, 41% of 50-64, and 43% of 65+ of those polled said they view her very favorably.

Obama should endorse Elizabeth Warren,"He recently said that he thinks women make better leaders, that men haven't been doing a good job and have been getting on his nerves.

So Obama should put his money where his mouth is and endorse Elizabeth Warren. Warren is more progressive than Obama was as president, but I think he is probably more progressive in his heart than he was in his actions as president. I hope that he realizes now that we need real, dramatic change to save our democracy and planet. And he probably knows that Joe Biden sucks and will not do that, despite having had him as VP. 

So many people will vote for Biden just because he is connected to Obama. It would be amazing if Obama let everyone know that he doesn't approve of that and the better candidate is Warren.

A heartwarming story for Monday morning...,"I just emailed this to Warren's campaign, but I wanted to share it here too. I really hope Warren gets to see this.

On Saturday, I went out for my birthday dinner with my sister and her family. My niece, all of 5 (and a half, as of May 12!), was sitting next to me, her favorite auntie in the whole world. She was playing with my phone, as five-year-olds love to do, and she saw my BOOT-EDGE-EDGE sticker on the back. ""Boot edge edge,"" she read. ""What's that?""

While I am a huge supporter of Mayor Pete, I am aware that a birthday dinner discussion with a five-year-old is not the appropriate place to talk politics. ""Well, Buttigieg is a man who wants to be President in 2020,"" I said, trying to keep it simple.

""Oh,"" my niece said. She looked at the sticker again, then up at me with a big smile. ""Well, he's not gonna be President!""

""Oh?"" I asked.

""Nope! Cause a GIRL is gonna be President!"" she declared, with all the confidence and surety of her five years.

My heart swelled about fifty sizes looking at her smile and knowing that in her lifetime, a girl WILL be President. I was momentarily speechless and so full of pride for my niece.

""Well, maybe,"" I said. ""There are a lot of girls running for President. Do you know any of them?""

She shook her head, so I turned my phone over and pulled up Google images.

My niece is a quarter Chinese, though she looks like a living embodiment of Dora the Explorer. Her po-po (Chinese for grandmother) immigrated here when she was sixteen, and I was actually in town for that amazing woman's funeral held on Mother's Day. I didn't know how early children started being aware of identity politics, so I decided to pull up Kamala first, as another woman of color to introduce to her. ""This is Kamala. Can you say Kamala? Kamala is running for President, but she works in Washington D.C. right now for the government, because,"" remembering a story about Warren, I smiled, ""that's what girls do.""

""Kamala,"" she repeated, looking politely at the phone.

No interest in Kamala. I started typing the next female candidate I could think of. E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H W-A-R-

""Elizabeth!?"" she read, perking up.

I hit the search button, and the screen filled with pictures of Elizabeth. My niece's eyes and mouth went wide, and she gave a small gasp.

""I want ELIZABETH to be President,"" she whispered in a hushed, reverential voice.

And in my head, I thought *Nevertheless, she persisted.*

I've since checked with my sister and her nanny. No one has talked politics with her before. She knows nothing about the history of only men being our president, and she probably couldn't name the current president if asked. My sister's family are lifelong Democrats but have no interest in the primary this far out. My niece reached this conclusion all on her own. The next president should be a girl, and Elizabeth should be that girl.

I'm still all-in on Mayor Pete, but Warren has been my number 2 all along, though this declaration clinches it. I've donated $20.20 to the Warren campaign in the name of my niece and will definitely be encouraging her support of Elizabeth, starting with a copy of TIME magazine (if I can find one!).",warren,"A heartwarming story for Monday morning...

"Elizabeth Warren’s Campaign, ‘Based on Ideas,’ Bets on Iowa","In case link doesn't show in article posting: [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa.html)

Stuff that seemed noteworthy or interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ms. Smith is one of about 50 paid staff members Ms. Warren’s campaign already has on the ground in Iowa, far more than any other Democratic candidate [is known to have hired in the state](https://iowastartingline.com/2020-staff/).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ms. Warren’s campaign spent more than $5 million over the first three months of the year, the most in the field, according to Federal Election Commission records. Her payroll included about 160 people during that period, far more than any other Democrat’s. Her team says its staff has grown even larger since then, to more than 200 people, over half of whom are based in early-voting states​.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For now, Ms. Warren, who won re-election in Massachusetts last year, has a financial cushion because she transferred $10.4 million to her presidential campaign from her Senate campaign account. She ended the first quarter with $11.2 million in cash on hand, trailing only Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic field.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Warren campaign’s Iowa headquarters, on the third floor of an office building in West Des Moines, suggests its operation still has plenty of growing to do. Last weekend, the headquarters sat mostly empty, with just a few pieces of mismatched furniture in a large open space. A lawn game had been set up in the middle of the room.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ms. Smith, the field organizer, began the gathering by talking about one of Ms. Warren’s latest policy proposals, a higher education plan that would [cancel student loan debt](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-student-debt.html?module=inline) for most borrowers and eliminate tuition at public colleges. The conversation soon moved to other topics, like Ms. Warren’s plan to [impose a wealth tax on households](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/us/politics/wealth-tax-democrats.html?module=inline) with a net worth exceeding $50 million.",warren,"Elizabeth Warren’s Campaign, ‘Based on Ideas,’ Bets on Iowa In case link doesn't show in article posting: [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa.html)

- Her experience on senate subcommittees

- Breakdowns of her recent policy proposals

- Maybe her previous experience and educations/simplified biography?

Question on funding for college debt relief,"I've seen a lot of posts on various social media outlets about Elizabeth Warren's college debt relief plan, which mention that it will be funded by a 2% tax on families with a net value over some threshold, $50 million I believe.

What I haven't seen is how she proposes to enact this tax. The proposed tax appears to be a wealth tax, which would be required to be apportioned among the states by population per Article I, Section 9, Clause of the Constitution. If it is apportioned, it isn't really a tax on the wealthy, as the states would determine how to collect it.

I'm not arguing on the validity of the cause, I'm just trying to figure out if this is a promise that has legs or it is just one that will be forgotten once the challenge of passing an amendment becomes clear.",warren,"Question on funding for college debt relief I've seen a lot of posts on various social media outlets about Elizabeth Warren's college debt relief plan, which mention that it will be funded by a 2% tax on families with a net value over some threshold, $50 million I believe.

More info on Student Loan / Higher Ed policy?,"I recently read [this article](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f) about how Elizabeth Warren plans on changing higher education. It sounds like a good plan, but I have some concerns.

In this new world of no-tuition education, how do Universities and colleges get paid? Are states / the federal government going to pay faculty and staff?

The article has just one sentence on this: 

&gt; The federal government will partner with states to split the costs of tuition and fees and ensure that states maintain their current levels of funding on need-based financial aid and academic instruction.

I would like more details on this part of her plan.

Specifically:

1. How long will this federal funding last?
2. How do you prevent this funding from being changed in the future, similar to how Social Security or Medicare are (or at least they are discussed to be changed).
3. What is going to stop universities from monetizing existing, free services, such as tutoring, or raising the prices on textbooks, to cover any gaps in federal funding?
4. Who decides what schools need? Will Harvard get more than a community college simply because of prestige?

She mentions it should be like K-12 education, but those programs have been grossly underfunded for years - [teachers have to go on strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_education_workers%27_strikes_in_the_United_States?wprov=sfti1) and [teachers are also spending their own money on basic school supplies like pencils](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/us/teachers-school-supplies.html).

Dukakis supporter- his endorsement may have gotten me on board.,"I'm not joking.

I'm a college student that initially thought Warren was too old and a little too stuck in the policy logistics to be the best candidate in the primary. But her in-depth policy proposals have been great, and I'll admit that I'm starting to think there are worse things to be in this campaign than old.

For years I've been a huge fan of Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, and Michael Dukakis. I feel that those 3 were some of the last true liberals before Bill Clinton dragged the party to the middle. Obviously that's a big simplification of a complex matter, and it's worth noting that all 3 of those guys lost elections in a row.

But Dukakis was a great politician. I'm big on prisoner's rights and mental health- he's always stood against the death penalty and he's openly discussed his wife's depression. So just now, when I heard that Warren has received Dukakis's endorsement, that may have been the straw that broke the camel's back.

I still like Harris and Buttigieg, and Klobuchar is out on the fringes too, but Warren probably just jumped to the top of my list.

I guess I just want to ask if you guys have any other supporting arguments for Warren over the candidates I listed- or why you have faith that she'll pull through. Her recent momentum is certainly promising!",warren,"Dukakis supporter- his endorsement may have gotten me on board. I'm not joking.

Working with Campaign?,"I'm a professional film, video, animation Post-Production guy and I am trying to make myself useful.

There's no way to do that except by putting in the extra time and effort.

Warren is the most electable Democrat,"The lie that Elizabeth Warren is less electable than her rival Democrats is one that has permeated the voter base, despite being objectively untrue, hence this deep dive. This is the problem: the media digs a hole for female candidates and dares them to crawl out of it. So we need to create a new narrative.

1) Let's start with the data. An oft cited example of Warren's lack of 'electability' is that she underperformed Hillary Clintons margins in MA in 2018 (she won by 24 points by the way). There is so much wrong with this conclusion I don't even know where to begin, so let's break it down.

* First of all, in safe blue states like MA voter turnout drops incredibly among Democrats during midterms. In 2016 voter turnout was at 75%, while in 2018 it was at 60%. This increases Republican vote share because Republicans generally turn out at higher rates than Democrats.

* Second, Warren ran the 2018 election on the fumes of her success. She didn't spend a single dollar on ads, while Charlie Baker spent 11 million. She barely campaigned, and spent most of her time stumping for other candidates across the country.

* Third, even with the uneven data, Warren underperformed among richer more affluent voters, and over performed Hillary with the poorer Obama-Trump voters. This is an argument FOR her electability on a national level not against it. (FiveThirtyEight did a deep dive [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/4-things-elizabeth-warrens-last-election-can-tell-us-about-2020/amp/).) 

* While Hillary lost the swing states, she definitely benefited from the Anti Trump vote in solid blue states and she beat Obamas 2012 margin by four points in MA. 

2) Now, on to the polling

* Warren actually does pretty well in national head to head polls, consistently polling better than the vast majority of the Democratic field (including Buttigieg, Beto and Harris). The only ones who do better are Bernie and Biden (I'll get to them in a bit). 

* These polls are not representative of Warren's actual electoral strength. She has high name ID because of the negative attacks on her character and the spotlight on her scandals, which increases the number of respondents who pick Trump. But in the next year and a half she will be able to get her message and her platform out across the country, directly from her. In other words, she's doing about as bad as she'll ever do right now, and she's doing great. She only goes up from here. I don't see any other scandals surfacing on her or Republicans would have brought it to the surface by now (there are literal PACs dedicated to opposing her). 

* Compare this to Biden and Bernie and the opposite is actually true, their leads are actually inflated. They are doing as well as they'll ever do and it only goes down from here. The biggest reason Biden does well against Trump in head to head matchups is because of the rose tinted hue his vice presidency has taken on. Much like Hillary when he is attacked on the issues and voters relalized he isn't Santa come to save them, his lead will drop. Drastically. He voted for the Iraq war, is pro big banks, crime bill. Basically he has nothing to offer the party expect for his 'electability' which will fade fast. 

* Bernie is a similar story but for different reasons. He has a lot of ammo that can be used against him to severely damage him in the general, most of which hasn't really come under the scrutiny of the public eye yet (the Boston Marathon bomber gaffe barely scratches the surface). But more importantly, he cannot unite the party. He is deeply hated by the pro Hillary faction of the party. He cannot unite the base. Warren has a MUCH wider appeal than him, and can unite the party in a way no other candidate can. 

3) Finally, Warren is the perfect contrast to Donald Trump, in a way Biden and Bernie can never be. They are both too similar to Trump, not just in looks but stylistically as well. She projects experience, and when people hear her talk her integrity and care for ordinary people shines through. She is intellectual but her policy ideas are ones that voters can understand.

Some questions about Warren's maternal health program,"Hi! I'm a new account, and have mostly lurked on reddit before this. I've been reluctant to get a reddit, but I really like Warren and I've been following the 2020 conversation pretty closely. This is a good faith question.

I searched the sub, but I couldn't find a lot of discussion on this front, so I'm making my first post. I'm worried that Elizabeth Warren's current plan to address Black Maternal Mortality disparities is going to hurt the people she is trying to address. 

Let me clarify: black women have very high maternal mortality for a bunch of reasons. Implicit bias and outright racism plays a huge part, no doubt, but they are also less likely to be insured, trust the health system less, are less likely to have good, consistent, and frequent prenatal care, and are more likely to be coming into a pregnancy with the health issues that make pregnancies risky (ex. diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.) They are also less likely to have transportation to an appointment. 

While I think it's great that Warren actually \*has an explicit plan\* for this, I worry that hospitals in urban areas with a high percentage of their patients being black are going to have higher rates of maternal mortality for all the predisposing issues that black women come into the healthcare system with. Therefore, hospitals that treat the most black women are the ones who are going to have the worst numbers, even if they are trying their best. Hospitals that treat mostly upper-class white women, who are healthy and have good insurance and access to an obstetrician to follow them through their pregnancy are going to do much better and be more likely to get incentives. Black women also use public hospitals more than white women, and those hospitals are often on a shoestring budget as is, so penalizing them financially for not improving is likely to actually hurt those institutions. 

Basically, I'm worried this is ""no child left behind"" for healthcare.

Request: can someone please explain how Warren’s student loan proposal makes sense? I’m someone who supported her wholeheartedly until this and want to reconcile it.,"I don’t want a debate, name-calling, etc like the comments in r/politics. I simply just want all my concerns addressed because from my understanding of the proposal, it’s almost a deal breaker for me so I must be missing something. Here are my concerns / questions:

1.) Why does this proposal that only helps college graduates even on the table? The American working class is far larger than degree holders. Yes, she has other proposals like expanding healthcare, but in terms of personal financial hardship, many working class Americans need relief not just degree holders (who have higher life time earnings).

2.) How can I, someone who killed myself to pay off my loans, support this? I missed out on years of contributing to retirement, saving for a home, experiencing life, etc. I don’t want other people to suffer but there are other options to make repayment easier including: making interest zero, cancelling all interest, refunding interest paid and canceling interest, allowing pre-tax dollars to be used, payment as a % of income max then forgiveness after X years etc. Canceling the principal to me simply seems like a hand out to a very specific group of people, not a “course correction”.  Many people didn’t just use student loans for the tuition in the bill, it was sometimes used for housing (including trendy expensive areas), pricey study abroad, spring break, etc. Why should tax payers pay for this? Especially when others didn’t indulge in such luxuries to limit debt? Not to mention, people who chose lesser schools that opened fewer doors to avoid debt or people who went into the workforce at 18 instead of following their passions after doing a fiscally conscious decision.

3.) Many are saying this won’t affect people negatively. I don’t understand how. There are many issues affecting all Americans, such as health care and rapidly increasing housing prices and that money can be used to fix those issues. You might say we can do both, but to do so, since the wealth tax is covering student debt exclusively , and we now have to tax everyone more for these other initiatives. Additionally, everyone saying “if this happened I’ll go buy a home! Travel! Go out to dinner!”. How is this a good thing for other people when housing prices are already ridiculously high? More demand will just inflate the market even more, along with everything else. Housing market is my biggest concern though. Even if I can keep up with the higher prices, I’ll be competing with people who didn’t prioritize their loans and thus have a higher asset profile after their debt gets wiped, whereas I’m out 50k with way less assets. 

4.) In regards to the economic stimulus argument: yes, more money = more economic activity. Why is this specific for degree holders? Why can’t everyone have a credit / benefit they can spend as an economic stimulus? I would also travel, dine out, etc if I had money given to me, not just student loan holders. 

5.) What about people who never dared to miss a student loan payment in fear of their credit, but then made ends meet via consumer debt/revolving credit? That won’t get written off even though it was a direct result of the student loans. It’s just a reallocation. How is this fair? 

6.) As a warren supporter, this plan seems so impossible that it made me distrust her. How can she make such a promise knowing the wealth tax alone will have a tough time passing congress, let alone spending it on student loan debt? This is the first time it made me see her as someone who cannot he trusted. People in r/studentloans are talking about not making payments or decreasing and thus building up more interest awaiting her win when even if she does win, it’s very unlikely it’ll pass and those people will be in worse positions. 

7.) In terms of the comparison to the Wall Street bailout- those were loans that were paid back to the government. Not a cancellation. Making interest zero and cancelling it for student loans would be even more than we did for the banks and seems really progressive and helpful IMO, and will even help more people because high earners like dentists who have 400k in debt will get a benefit as well (not phased out due to income). Why is blanket forgiveness the go-to when other options that imo seem more reasonable and possible exist? 

Please someone address these concerns. I’d like to restore my faith in warren if possible.
